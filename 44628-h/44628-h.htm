<h2><a id="LYRIC">LYRIC AND DRAMATIC ELEMENTS IN
LITERATURE AND ART</a></h2>

<p>The German philosophy has made a distinction
between the Subjective and the Objective, which
has been found so convenient that it has been already
naturalized and is almost acclimated in our
literature.</p>

<p>The distinction is this: in all thought there are
two factors, the thinker himself, and that about
which he thinks. All thought, say our friends the
Germans, results from these two factors: the subject,
or the man thinking; and the object, what
the man thinks about. All that part of thought
which comes from the man himself, the Ego,
they call subjective; all that part which comes
from the outside world, the non-Ego, they call objective.</p>

<p>I am about to apply this distinction to literature
and art; but instead of the terms Subjective and
Objective, I shall use the words Lyric and Dramatic.</p>

<p>For example, when a writer or an artist puts
a great deal of himself into his work, I call him
a lyric writer or artist. Lyrical, in poetry, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
term applied to that species of poetry which directly
expresses the individual emotions of the poet. On
the other hand, I call an artist or poet dramatic
when his own personality disappears, and is lost
in that which he paints or describes. A lyric or
subjective writer gives us more of himself than of
the outside world; a dramatic or objective writer
gives us more of the outside world than of himself.</p>

<p>Lyric poetry is that which is to be sung; the
lyre accompanies song. Now, song is mainly
personal or subjective. It expresses the singer's
personal emotions, feelings, desires; and for these
reasons I select this phrase "lyric" to express all
subjective or personal utterances in art.</p>

<p>The drama, on the other hand, is a photograph
of life; of live men and women acting themselves
out freely and individually. The dramatic writer
ought to disappear in his drama; if he does not
do so he is not a dramatic writer, but a lyrist in
disguise.</p>

<p>The dramatic element is the power of losing one's
self&mdash;opinions, feeling, character&mdash;in that which
is outside and foreign, and reproducing it just as
it is. In perfect dramatic expression the personal
equation is wholly eliminated. The writer disappears
in his characters; his own hopes and fears,
emotions and convictions, do not color his work.</p>

<p>But the lyric element works in the opposite way.
In song, the singer is prominent more than what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
he sings. He suffuses his subject with his own
thoughts and feelings. If he describes nature, he
merely gives us the feelings it awakens in his own
mind. If he attempts to write a play, we see the
same actor thinly disguised reappearing in all the
parts.</p>

<p>Now, there is a curious fact connected with
this subject. It is that great lyric and dramatic
authors or artists are apt to appear in duads or
pairs. Whenever we meet with a highly subjective
writer, we are apt to find him associated with
another as eminently objective. This happens so
often that one might imagine that each type of
thought attracts its opposite and tends to draw
it out and develop it. It may be that genius,
when it acts on disciples who are persons of talent,
draws out what is like itself, and makes imitators;
when it acts on a disciple who himself possesses
genius, it draws out what is opposite to itself and
develops another original thinker. Genius, like
love, is attracted by its opposite, or counterpart.
Love and genius seek to form wholes; they look
for what will complete and fulfill themselves.
When, therefore, a great genius has come, fully
developed on one side, he exercises an irresistible
attraction on the next great genius, in whom
the opposite side is latent, and is an important
factor in his development. Thus, perhaps, we obtain
the duads, whose curious concurrence I will
now illustrate by a few striking instances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Beginning our survey with English literature,
who are the first two great poets whose names
occur to us? Naturally, Chaucer and Spenser.
Now, Chaucer is eminently dramatic and objective
in his genius; while Spenser is distinctly a lyrical
and subjective poet.</p>

<p>Chaucer tells stories; and story-telling is objective.
One of the most renowned collections of
stories is the "Arabian Nights;" but who knows
anything about the authors of those entertaining
tales? They are merely pictures of Eastern life,
reflected in the minds of some impersonal authors,
whose names even are unknown.</p>

<p>Homer is another great story-teller; and Homer
is so objective, so little of a personality, that some
modern critics suppose there may have been several
Homers.</p>

<p>Chaucer is a story-teller also; and in his stories
everything belonging to his age appears, except
Chaucer himself. His writings are full of pictures
of life, sketches of character; in one word, he is
a dramatic or objective writer. He paints things
as they are,&mdash;gives us a panorama of his period.
Knights, squires, yeomen, priests, friars, pass before
us, as in Tennyson's poem "The Lady of
Shalott."</p>

<p>The mind of an objective story-teller, like Chaucer,
is the faithful mirror, which impartially reflects
all that passes before it, but cracks from side
to side whenever he lets a personal feeling enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
his mind, for then the drama suddenly disappears
and a lyric of personal hope or fear, gladness or
sadness, takes its place.</p>

<p>Spenser is eminently a lyric poet. His own
genius suffuses his stories with a summer glow of
warm, tender, generous sentiment. In his descriptions
of nature he does not catalogue details, but
suggests impressions, which is the only way of
truly describing nature. There are some writers
who can describe scenery, so that the reader feels
as if he had seen it himself. The secret of all
such description is that it does not count or measure,
but suggests. It is not quantitative but qualitative
analysis. It does not apply a foot rule to
nature, but gives the impression made on the mind
and heart by the scene. I have never been at
Frascati nor in Sicily, but I can hardly persuade
myself that I have not seen those places. I have
distinct impressions of both, simply from reading
two of George Sand's stories. I have in my mind
a picture of Frascati, with deep ravines, filled
with foliage; with climbing, clustering, straggling
vines and trees and bushes; with overhanging
crags, deep masses of shadow below, bright sunshine
on the stone pines above. So I have another
picture of Sicilian scenery, wide and open, with
immense depths of blue sky, and long reaches of
landscape; ever-present Etna, soaring snow-clad
into the still air; an atmosphere of purity, filling
the heart with calm content. It may be that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Catania and Frascati are not like this; but I feel
as if I had seen them, not as if I had heard them
described.</p>

<p>It is thus that Spenser describes nature; by
touching some chord of fancy in the soul. Notice
this picture of a boat on the <span class="locked">sea:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"So forth they rowëd; and that Ferryman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his stiff oars did brush the sea so strong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the hoar waters from his frigate ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the light bubbles dancëd all along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whiles the salt brine out of the billows sprang;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last, far off, they many islands spy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On every side, floating the floods among."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>You notice that you are in the boat yourself,
and everything is told as it appears to you there;
you see the bending of the "stiff oars" by your
side, and the little bubbles dancing on the water,
and the islands, not as they <em>are</em>, rock-anchored,
but as they <em>seem</em> to you, floating on the water.
This is subjective description,&mdash;putting the reader
in the place, and letting him see it all from that
point of view. So Spenser speaks of the "oars
sweeping the watery wilderness;" and of the gusty
winds "filling the sails with fear."</p>

<p>Perhaps the highest description ought to include
both the lyric and dramatic elements. Here is a
specimen of sea description, by an almost unknown
American poet, Fenner, perfect in its way. The
poem is called "Gulf <span class="locked">Weed:"&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"A weary weed washed to and fro,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Drearily drenched in the ocean brine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soaring high, or sinking low,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lashed along without will of mine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sport of the spoom of the surging sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Flung on the foam afar and near;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mark my manifold mystery,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Growth and grace in their place appear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"I bear round berries, gray and red,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rootless and rover though I be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My spangled leaves, when nicely spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Arboresce as a trunkless tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Corals curious coat me o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i2">White and hard in apt array;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mid the wild waves' rude uproar<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Gracefully grow I, night and day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Hearts there are on the sounding shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(Something whispers soft to me,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Restless and roaming for evermore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like this weary weed of the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bear they yet on each beating breast<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The eternal Type of the wondrous whole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Growth unfolding amidst unrest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Grace informing the silent soul."<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>All nature becomes alive in the Spenserian
description. Take, for example, the wonderful
stanza which describes the music of the "Bower
of <span class="locked">Bliss:"&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p><div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i4q">"The joyous birds, shrouded in cheerful shade<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Their notes unto the voice attemper'd sweet;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Th' angelical, soft, trembling voices made<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To the instruments divine respondence meet;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The silver-sounding instruments did meet<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With the bass murmur of the water's fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The water's fall, with difference discreet,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Now loud, now low, unto the winds did call;<br /></span>

<p>If we examine this picture, we see that it is not
a photograph, such as the sun makes, but a lover's
description of his mistress. He sees her, not as
she is, but as she is to <em>him</em>. He paints her out of
his own heart. In her eyes he sees, not only brilliancy
and color, but heavenly light; he reads in
them an untouched purity of soul. Looking at her
forehead, he sees, not whiteness and roundness,
but goodness and honor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Shakespeare's lovers always describe their mistresses
in this way, out of their own soul and heart.
It is his own feeling that the lover gives, seeing
perhaps "Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt."</p>

<p>After Chaucer and Spenser the next great English
poets whose names naturally occur to us are
Shakespeare and Milton.</p>

<p>Now, Shakespeare was the most objective dramatic
writer who ever lived; while Milton was eminently
and wholly a subjective and lyrical writer.</p>

<p>It is true that Shakespeare was so great that he
is one of the very few men of genius in whom appear
both of these elements. In his plays he is so
objective that he is wholly lost in his characters,
and his personality absolutely disappears; in his
sonnets he "unlocks his heart" and is lyrical and
subjective; he there gives us his inmost self, and
we seem to know him as we know a friend with
whom we have lived in intimate relations for years.
Still, he will be best remembered by his plays;
and into them he put the grandeur and universality
of his genius; so we must necessarily consider
him as the greatest dramatic genius of all time.
But he belonged to a group of dramatic poets of
whom he was the greatest: Ben Jonson, Beaumont
and Fletcher, Massinger, Ford, Webster,&mdash;any
one of whom would make the fortune of the stage
to-day. It was a great age of dramatic literature,
and it came very naturally to meet a demand.
The play then was what the novel is to-day. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
people to-day have no sooner read a new novel than
they want another, so, in Shakespeare's time, they
had no sooner seen a new play than they ran to
see another. Hence the amazing fertility of the
dramatic writers. Thomas Heywood wrote the
whole or a part of two hundred and twenty plays.
The manager of one of the theatres bought a hundred
and six new plays for his stage in six years;
and in the next five years a hundred and sixty.
The price paid to an author for a play would now
be equal to about two or three hundred dollars.
The dramatic element, as is natural, abounds in
these writings, though in some of them the author's
genius is plainly lyrical. Such, for example,
is Massinger's, who always reminds me of Schiller.
Both wrote plays, but in both writers the faculty
of losing themselves in their characters is wanting.
The nobleness of Schiller appears in all his works,
and constitutes a large part of their charm. So in
Massinger all tends to generosity and elevation.
His worst villains are ready to be converted and
turn saints at the least provocation. Their wickedness
is in a condition of unstable equilibrium;
it topples over, and goodness becomes supreme in
a single moment. Massinger could not create
really wicked people; their wickedness is like a
child's moment of passion or willfulness, ending
presently in a flood of tears, and a sweet reconciliation
with his patient mother. But how different
was it with Shakespeare! Consider his Iago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
How deeply rooted was his villainy! how it was
a part of the very texture of his being! He had
conformed to it the whole philosophy of his life.
His cynical notions appear in the first scene. Iago
<em>believes</em> in meanness, selfishness, everything that is
base; to him all that seems good is either a pretense
or a weakness. The man who does not seek
the gratification of his own desires is a fool.
There is to Iago nothing sweet, pure, fair, or true,
in this world or the next. He profanes everything
he touches. He sneers at the angelic innocence of
Desdemona; he sneers at the generous, impulsive
soul of Othello. When some one speaks to him of
virtue, he says "Virtue? a fig! ’tis in ourselves
that we are thus or thus. Our bodies are our gardens,
to which our wills are gardeners." You can
plant nettles or lettuce as you please. That is to
say, there is no reality in goodness. The virtue of
Desdemona will be gone to-morrow, if she takes
the whim. The Moor's faith in goodness is folly;
it will cause him to be led by the nose. There is
no converting such a man as that; or only when,
by means of terrible disappointments and anguish,
he is brought to see the reality of human goodness
and divine providence. And that can hardly happen
to him in this world.</p>

<p>Iago is a murderer of the soul, Macbeth a murderer
of the body. The wickedness of Macbeth
is different from that of Iago; that of Shylock
and of Richard Third different again from either.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Macbeth is a half-brute, a man in a low state of
development, with little intellect and strong passions.
Shylock is a highly intellectual man, not
a cynic like Iago, but embittered by ill-treatment,
made venomous by cruel wrong and perpetual contempt.
Oppression has made this wise man mad.
Richard Third, originally bad, has been turned into
a cruel monster by the egotism born of power.
He has the contempt for his race that belongs to
the aristocrat, who looks on men in humbler places
as animals of a lower order made for his use or
amusement. Now, this wonderful power of differentiating
characters belongs to the essence of the
dramatic faculty. Each of these is developed
from within, from a personal centre, and is true to
that. Every manifestation of this central life is
correlated to every other. If one of Shakespeare's
characters says but ten words in one scene, and
then ten words more in another, we recognize him
as the same person. His speech bewrayeth him.
So it is in human life. Every man is fatally consistent
with himself. So, after we have seen a
number of pictures by any one of the great masters,
we recognize him again, as soon as we enter a gallery.
We know him by a certain style. Inferior
artists have a manner; great artists have a
style; manner is born of imitation; style of originality.
So, there is a special quality in every human
being, if he will only allow it to unfold. The
dramatic faculty recognizes this. Its knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
of man is not a philosophy, nor a mere knowledge
of human nature, but a perception of individual
character. It first integrates men as human beings;
then differentiates them as individuals.
Play-writers, novelists, and artists who do not possess
this dramatic genius cannot grow their characters
from within, from a personal centre of life;
but build them up from without, according to a
plan. In description of nature, however, Shakespeare
is, as he ought to be, subjective and lyric;
he touches nature with human feelings. Take his
description of a <span class="locked">brook:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"The current that with gentle murmur glides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou know'st, being stopp'd impatiently doth rage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when his fair course is not hindered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He makes sweet music with the enamell'd stones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so by many winding nooks he strays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With willing sport to the wild ocean."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The brook is gentle; then it becomes angry;
then it is pacified and begins to sing; then it stops
to kiss the sedge; then it is a pilgrim; and it
walks <em>willingly</em> on to the ocean.</p>

<p>So in his <span class="locked">sonnet:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p><div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"Full many a glorious morning have I seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flatter the mountain top with sovereign eye;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Anon permit the basest clouds to ride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ugly rack on his celestial face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the forlorn world his visage hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stealing unseen to west with his disgrace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even so my sun one early morn did shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all triumphant splendor on my brow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The region cloud hath masked him from me now;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet him, for this, my love no whit disdaineth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suns of this world may stain, when heaven's sun staineth."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From Shakespeare, the marvel of dramatic genius,
turn to Milton, and we find the opposite tendency
unfolded.</p>

<p>The "Paradise Lost" is indeed dramatic in
form, with different characters and dialogues, in
hell, on earth, and in heaven. But in essence it is
undramatic. Milton is never for a moment lost in
his characters; his grand and noble soul is always
appearing. Every one speaks as Milton would
have spoken had Milton been in the same place,
and looked at things from the same point of view.
Sin and Satan, for example, both talk like John
Milton. Sin is very conscientious, and before she
will unlock the gate of hell she is obliged to argue
herself into a conviction that it is right to do so.
Satan, she says, is her father, and children ought to
obey their parents; so, since he tells her to unlock
the gate, she ought to do so. Death reproaches
Satan, in good set terms, for his treason against
the Almighty; and Satan, as we all know, utters
the noblest sentiments, and talks as Milton would
have talked, had Milton been in Satan's <span class="locked">position.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>
<p>Coming down nearer to our own time, we find a
duad of great English poets, usually associated in
our minds,&mdash;Byron and Scott.</p>

<p>Scott was almost the last of the dramatic poets
of England, using the word dramatic in its large
sense. His plays never amounted to much; but
his stories in verse and in prose are essentially dramatic.
In neither does he reveal himself. In all
his poetry you scarcely find a reference to his personal
feelings. In the L'Envoi to the "Lady of
the Lake" there is a brief allusion of this sort,
touching because so unusual, and almost the only
one I now recall. Addressing the "Harp of the
North" he <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i2q">"Much have I owed thy strains through life's long way,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Through secret woes the world has never known,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When on the weary night dawned wearier day,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And bitterer was the grief devoured alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I o'erlive such woes, Enchantress! is thine own."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Scott, like Chaucer, brings before us a long succession
of characters, from many classes, countries,
and times. Scotch barons and freebooters, English
kings, soldiers, gentlemen, crusaders, Alpine
peasants, mediæval counts, serfs, Jews, Saxons,&mdash;brave,
cruel, generous,&mdash;all sweep past us, in a
long succession of pictures; but of Scott himself
nothing appears except the nobleness and purity
of the tone which pervades all. He is therefore
eminently a dramatic or objective writer.</p>

<p>But Byron is the exact opposite. The mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
exuberance of his genius, which captivated his age,
and the echoes of which thrill down to ours, in all
its vast overflow of passion, imagination, wit,&mdash;ever
sounded but one strain,&mdash;himself. His own
woes, his own wrongs are the ever-recurring theme.
Though he wrote many dramas, he was more undramatic
than Milton. Every character in every
play is merely a thinly disguised Byron. It was
impossible for him to get away from himself. If
Tennyson's lovely line tells the truth when he
<span class="locked">says,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"Love took up the harp of life and smote on all its chords with might;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smote the chord of self, that, trembling, passed in music out of sight:"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">then Byron never really loved; for in his poetry
the chord of self never passes out of sight.</p>

<p>In his plays the principal characters are Byron
undiluted&mdash;as Manfred, Sardanapalus, Cain,
Werner, Arnold. All the secondary characters
are Byron more or less diluted,&mdash;Byron and
water, may we say? Never, since the world began,
has there been a poet so steeped in egotism,
so sick of self-love as he; and the magnificence of
his genius appears in the unfailing interest which
he can give to this monotonous theme.</p>

<p>But he was the example of a spirit with which
the whole age was filled to saturation. Almost all
the nineteenth century poets of England are subjective,
giving us their own experience, sentiments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
reflections, philosophies. Wordsworth, Coleridge,
Shelley, Keats, revolve in this enchanted and
enchanting circle. Keats and Coleridge seem
capable of something different. So, in the double
star, made up of Wordsworth and Coleridge, the
first is absolutely personal and lyric, the second
sometimes objective and dramatic. And in that
other double star of Shelley and Keats the same
difference may be noted.</p>

<p>A still more striking instance of the combination
of these antagonisms is to be found in our
time, in Robert Browning and his wife. Mrs.
Browning is wholly lyric, like a bird which sings
its own tender song of love and hope and faith till
"that wild music burdens every bough;" and
those "mournful hymns" hush the night to listening
sympathy.</p>

<p>But in her husband we have a genuine renaissance
of the old dramatic power of the English
bards. Robert Browning is <em>so</em> dramatic that he
forgets himself and his readers too, in his characters
and their situations. To study the varieties
of men and women is his joy; to reproduce them
unalloyed, his triumph.</p>

<p>One curious instance of this self-oblivious immersion
in the creations of his mind occurs to me. In
one of his early poems called "In a Gondola"&mdash;as
it first appeared&mdash;two lovers are happily conversing,
until in a moment, we know not why, the
tone becomes one of despair, and they bid each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
other an eternal farewell. Why this change of
tone there is no explanation. In a later edition he
condescends to inform us, inserting a note to this
effect: "He is surprised and stabbed." This is
the opposite extreme to Milton's angels carefully
explaining to each other that they possess a specific
levity which enables them to drop upward.</p>

<p>If we think of our own poets whose names are
usually connected,&mdash;Longfellow and Lowell, for
instance,&mdash;we shall easily see which is dramatic and
which lyric. But the only man of truly dramatic
faculty whom we have possessed was one in whom
the quality never fully ripened,&mdash;I mean Edgar
Allan Poe.</p>

<p>In foreign literature we may trace the same
tendency of men of genius to arrange themselves
in couplets. Take, for instance, in Italy, Dante
and Petrarch; in France, Voltaire and Rousseau;
in Germany, Goethe and Schiller. Dante is dramatic,
losing himself in his stern subject, his
dramatic characters; his awful pictures of gloomy
destiny. Petrarch is lyrical, personal, singing forever
his own sad and sweet fate. Again, Voltaire
is essentially dramatic,&mdash;immersed in things, absorbed
in life, a man reveling in all human accident
and adventure, and aglow with faith in an
earthly paradise. The sad Rousseau goes apart,
away from men; standing like Byron, among them,
but not of them; in a cloud of thoughts that are
not their thoughts. And, once more, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Goethe resembles Shakespeare in this, that some
of his works are subjective, and others objective,&mdash;though,
in the greatness of his mind he reconciles
all the usual antagonisms of thought,&mdash;yet the
fully developed Goethe, like the fully developed
Shakespeare, disappears in his characters and
theme. Life to him, in all its forms, was so intensely
interesting that his own individual and
subjective sentiments are left out of sight. But
Schiller stands opposed to Goethe, as being a dramatist
devoid of dramatic genius, but full of personal
power; so grand in his nobleness of soul, so
majestic in the aspirations of his sentiment, so
full of patriotic ardor and devotion to truth and
goodness, that he moves all hearts as he walks
through his dramas,&mdash;the great poet visible in
every scene and every line. As his tried and
noble friend says of him in an equally undying
<span class="locked">strain:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"Burned in his cheek, with ever-deepening fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spirit's youth, which never passes by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The courage, which though worlds in hate conspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conquers at last their dull hostility;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lofty faith, which ever, mounting higher,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now presses on, now waiteth patiently;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By which the good tends ever to its goal&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By which day lights at last the generous soul."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Goethe's characters and stories covered the
widest range: Faust, made sick with too much
thought, and seeking outward joy as a relief;
Werther, a self-absorbed sentimentalist; Tasso, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
Italian man of genius, a mixture of imagination,
aspiration, sensitive self-distrust; susceptible to
opinion, sympathetic; Iphigenia, a picture of antique
calm, simplicity, purity, classic repose, like
that of a statue; Hermann and Dorothea, a sweet
idyl of modern life, in a simple-minded German
village with an opinionated, honest landlord, a
talkative apothecary, a motherly landlady, a sensible
and good pastor, and the two young lovers.</p>

<p>This law of duality, or reaction of genius on
genius, will also be found to apply to artists, philosophers,
historians, orators. These also come in
pairs, manifesting the same antagonistic qualities.</p>

<p>Some artists are lyric; putting their own souls
into every face, every figure, making even a landscape
alive with their own mood; <span class="locked">adding&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i30q">"A gleam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lustre known to neither sea nor land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But borrowed from the poet-painter's dream."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In every landscape of Claude we find the soul
of Claude; in every rugged rock-defile of Salvator
we read his mood. These artists are lyric; but there
are also great dramatic painters, who give you, not
themselves, but men and women; so real, so differentiated,
characters so full of the variety and
antagonism of nature, that the whole life of a
period springs into being at their touch.</p>

<p>Take for instance two names, which always go
together, standing side by side at the summit
of Italian art,&mdash;Michael Angelo and Raphael.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Though Raphael was a genius of boundless exuberance,
and poured on the wall and canvas a flood
of forms, creating as nature creates, without pause
or self-repetition, yet there is a tone in all which
irresistibly speaks of the artist's own soul. He
created a world of Raphaels. Grace, sweetness,
and tenderness went into all his work. Every line
has the same characteristic qualities.</p>

<p>Turn to the frescoes by Michael Angelo in the
Sistine Chapel. As we look up at those mighty
forms&mdash;prophets, sibyls, seers, with multitudes of
subordinate figures&mdash;we gradually trace in each
prophet, king, or bard an individual character.
Each one is himself. How fully each face and
attitude is differentiated by some inward life.
How each&mdash;David, Isaiah, Ezekiel, the Persian
and the Libyan sibyl&mdash;stands out, distinct, filled
with a power or a tenderness all his own. Michael
Angelo himself is not there, except as a fountain
of creative life, from whose genius all these
majestic persons come forth as living realities.</p>

<p>Hanging on my walls are the well-known engravings
of Guido's Aurora and Leonardo da
Vinci's Last Supper. One of these is purely lyrical;
the other as clearly dramatic.</p>

<p>The Aurora is so exquisitely lovely, the forms
so full of grace, the movement of all the figures so
rapid yet so firm, that I can never pass it without
stopping to enjoy its charms. But variety is absent.
The hours are lovely sisters, as Ovid describes
<span class="locked">sisters:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem" xml:lang="la" lang="la">
<span class="i0q">"Facies non omnibus una,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nec diversa tamen, qualis decet esse sororum."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But when we turn to the Last Supper, we see
the dramatic artist at his best. The subject is
such as almost to compel a monotonous treatment,
but there is a wonderful variety in the attitudes
and grouping. Each apostle shows by his attitude,
gesture, expression, that he is affected differently
from all the others. Even the feet under
the table speak. Stand before the picture;
put yourself into the attitude of each apostle,
and you will immediately understand his state of
<span class="locked">mind.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span></p>

<p>The mediæval religious artists were subjective,
sentimental, lyrical. In a scene like the crucifixion,
all the characters, whether apostles, Roman
soldiers, or Jewish Pharisees, hang their heads like
bulrushes.</p>

<p>But see how Rubens, that great dramatic painter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
represents the scene. The Magdalen, wild with
grief, with disheveled hair, has thrown herself at
the foot of the cross, clasping and kissing the feet
of Jesus. On the other faces are terror, dismay,
doubt, unbelief, mockery, curiosity, triumph, despair,&mdash;according
to each person's character and
attitude toward the event. Meantime the Roman
centurion, seated on his splendid horse, is deliberately
and carefully striking his spear into the side
of the sufferer. His face expresses only that he
has a duty to perform and means to fulfill it perfectly.</p>

<p>As Rubens is greatly dramatic, his pupil and
follower, Vandyke, is a great lyrical artist, whose
noble aspiration and generous sentiment shows
itself in all his work.</p>

<p>The school of Venice, with Titian and Tintoretto
at its head, is grandly dramatic and objective.
The school of Florence, with Guido and
Domenichino at its head, eminently lyrical and
subjective.</p>

<p>If we had time, we might show that the two
masters of Greek philosophy, Plato and Aristotle,
are, the one lyrical, and intensely subjective, platonizing
the universe; and the other as evidently
objective, immersed in the study of things; rejoicing
in their variety, their individuality, their
persistence of type.</p>

<p>The two masters of Greek history, Herodotus
and Thucydides, stand opposed to each other in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
same way. Herodotus is the story-teller, the dramatic
raconteur, whose charming tales are as entertaining
as the "Arabian Nights." Thucydides is
the personal historian who puts himself into his
story, and determines its meaning and moral according
to his own theories and convictions.</p>

<p>We have another example in Livy and Tacitus.</p>

<p>The two great American orators most frequently
mentioned together are Webster and Clay.
Though you would smile if I were to call either of
them a lyric or a dramatic speaker, yet the essential
distinction we have been considering may be
clearly seen in them. Clay's inspiration was personal,
his influence, personal influence. His theme
was nothing; his treatment of it everything. But
Webster rose or fell with the magnitude and importance
of the occasion and argument. When
on the wrong side, he failed, for his intellect
would not work well except in the service of
reality and truth. But Clay was perhaps greatest
when arguing against all facts and all reason.
Then he summoned all his powers,&mdash;wit, illustration,
analogy, syllogisms, appeals to feeling,
prejudice, and passion; and so swept along his
confused and blinded audience to his conclusions.</p>

<p>I think that subjective writers are loved more
than dramatic. We admire the one and we love
the other. We admire Shakespeare and love Milton;
we admire Chaucer and love Spenser; we
admire Dante and love Petrarch; we admire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Goethe and love Schiller; and if Byron had not
been so selfish a man, we should have loved him
too. We admire Michael Angelo and love Raphael;
we admire Rubens and love Vandyke; we admire
Robert Browning and love Mrs. Browning. In
short, we care more for the man who gives us
himself than for the man who gives us the whole
outside world.</p>

<p>I have been able to give you only a few hints
of this curious distinction in art and literature.
But if we carry it in our mind, we shall find it
a key by which many doors may be unlocked.
It will enable us to classify authors, and understand
them better.</p>

<h2><a id="DUALISM">DUALISM IN NATIONAL LIFE</a></h2>

<p>The science of comparative ethnology is one
which has been greatly developed during the last
twenty-five years. The persistence of race tendencies,
as in the Semitic tribes, Jews and Arabs,
or in the Teutonic and Celtic branches of the great
Aryan stock, has been generally admitted. Though
few would now say, with the ethnologist Knox,
"Race is everything," none would wholly dispense
with this factor, as Buckle did, in writing a history
of civilization.</p>

<p>Racial varieties have existed from prehistoric
times. Their origin is lost in the remote past.
As far as history goes back, we find them the same
that they are now. When and how the primitive
stock differentiated itself into the great varieties
which we call Aryan, Semitic, and Turanian, no
one can tell. But there are well-established varieties
of which we can trace the rise and development;
I mean national varieties. The character
of an Englishman or a Frenchman is as distinctly
marked as that of a Greek or Roman. There is a
general resemblance among all Englishmen; and
the same kind of resemblance among all Frenchmen,
Spaniards, Swedes, Poles. But this crystallization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
into national types of character has taken
place in a comparatively short period. We look
back to a time when there were no Englishmen in
Great Britain; but only Danes, Saxons, Normans,
and Celts; no Frenchmen in France; but Gauls,
Franks, and Romans. Gradually a distinct quality
emerges, and we have Frenchmen, Italians, Englishmen.
The type, once arrived at, persists, and
becomes more marked. It is marked by personal
looks and manners, by a common temperament,
a common style of thinking, feeling, acting; the
same kind of morals and manners. This type was
formed by the action and reaction of the divers
races brought side by side&mdash;Normans and Saxons
mutually influencing each other in England, and
being influenced again by climate, conditions of
life, forms of government, national customs. So,
at last, we have the well-developed national character,&mdash;a
mysterious but very certain element, from
which no individual can wholly escape. All drink
of that one spirit.</p>

<p>Thus far I have been stating what we all know.
But now I would call your attention to a curious
fact, which, so far as I am aware, has not before
been noticed. It is this,&mdash;that when two nations,
during their forming period, have been in relation
to each other, there will be a peculiar character
developed in each. That is to say, they will differ
from each other according to certain well-defined
lines, and these differences will repeat themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
again and again in history, in curious parallelisms,
or dualisms.</p>

<p>To take the most familiar illustration of this:
consider the national qualities of the French and
English. The English and French, during several
centuries, have been acting and reacting on each
other, both in war and peace. Now, what are the
typical characteristics of these two nations?
Stated in a broad way they might be described
something as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The English mind is more practical than ideal;
its movement is slow but persistent; its progress
is by gradual development; it excels in the industrial
arts; it reverences power; it loves liberty
more than equality, not objecting to an aristocracy.
It tends to individualism. Its conquests have been
due to the power of order, and adherence to law.</p>

<p>The French mind is more ideal than practical;
versatile, rather than persistent; its movements
rapid, its progress by crises and revolution, rather
than by development; it excels in whatever is
tasteful and artistic; it admires glory rather than
power; loves equality more than liberty; objects
to an aristocracy, but is ready to yield individual
rights at the bidding of the community; renouncing
individualism for the sake of communism;
and its successes have been due to enthusiasm
rather than to organization.</p>

<p>Next, look at the Greeks and Romans. These
peoples were in intimate relations during the forming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
period of national life; and we find in them
much the same contrasts of character that we do
in the English and the French. The Romans were
deficient in imagination, rather prosaic, fond of
rule and fixed methods, conservative of ancient
customs. The Greeks were quick and versatile;
artistic to a high degree; producing masterpieces
of architecture, painting, statuary, and creating
every form of literature; inventing the drama, the
epic poem, oratory, odes, history, philosophy. The
Romans borrowed from them their art and their
literature, but were themselves the creators of law,
the organizers of force. The Greeks and Romans
were the English and French of antiquity; and
you will notice that they occupy geographically the
same relative positions,&mdash;the Greeks and French
on the east; the Romans and English on the west.</p>

<p>But now observe another curious fact. The
Roman Empire and the Greek republics came to
an end; and in Greece no important nationality
took the place of those wonderful commonwealths.
But in Italy, by the union of the old inhabitants
with the Teutonic northern invaders, modern Italy
was slowly formed into a new national life. No
longer deriving any important influence from
Greece (which had ceased to be a living and independent
force), Italy, during the Middle Ages,
came into relations with Spain and the Spaniards.
In Spain, as in Italy, a new national life was in
process of formation by the union of the Gothic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
tribes, the Mohammedan invaders, and the ancient
inhabitants. The Spaniards occupied Sicily in
1282, and Naples fell later into their hands, about
1420, and in 1526 took possession of Milan. Thus
Italy and Spain were entangled in complex relations
during their forming period. What was the
final result? Modern Italians became the very
opposite of the ancient Romans. The Spaniards
on the west are now the Romans, and the Italians,
the Greeks. The Spaniards are slow, strong, conservative;
the Italians, quick-witted, full of feeling
and sentiment, versatile. The Spaniards trust
to organization, the Italians to enthusiasm. The
Spaniards are practical, the Italians ideal. In
fine, the Spaniards, on the west, are like the English
and the ancient Romans; the Italians, on the
east, like the French and the Greeks. The English
pride, the Roman pride, the Spanish pride, we
have all heard of; but the French, the Greeks, and
the Italians are not so much inclined to pride and
the love of power, as to vanity and the love of fame.
England, Rome, and Spain, united by law and
the love of organization, gradually became solidified
into empires; Greece, Italy, and France were
always divided into independent states, provinces,
or republics.</p>

<p>Now, let us go east and consider two empires
that have grown up, side by side, with constant
mutual relations: Japan and China. The people
of Japan, on the east, are described by all travelers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
in language that might be applied to the ancient
Greeks or the modern French. They are said to
be quick-witted, lively, volatile, ready of apprehension,
with a keen sense of honor, which prefers
death to disgrace; eminently a social and pleasure-seeking
people, fond of feasts, dancing, music, and
frolics. Men and women are pleasing, polite,
affable. On the other hand, the Chinese are described
as more given to reason than to sentiment,
prosaic, slow to acquire, but tenacious of all that is
gained, very conservative, great lovers of law and
order; with little taste for art, but much national
pride. They are the English of Asia; the Japanese,
the French.</p>

<p>Go back to earlier times, when the two oldest
branches of the great Aryan stock diverged on the
table-lands of central Asia; the Vedic race descending
into India, and the Zend people passing
west, into Persia. The same duplex development
took place that we have seen in other instances.
The people on the Indus became what they still
are,&mdash;a people of sentiment and feeling. Like
the French, they are polite, and cultivate civility
and courtesy. The same tendency to local administration
which we see in France is found in India;
the commune being, in both, the germ-cell of national
life. The village communities in India are
little republics, almost independent of anything
outside. Dynasties change, new rulers and kings
arrive; Hindoo, Mohammedan, English; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
village community remains the same. Like the
Japanese, the French, the Italians, the inhabitants
of India are skillful manufacturers of ornamental
articles. Their religion tends to sentiment more
than to morality,&mdash;to feeling, rather than to action.
This is the development which India took
when these races inhabited the Punjaub. But
the ancient Persians were different. Their religion
included a morality which placed its essence in
right thinking and right action. A sentimental
religion, like that of India and of Italy, tends to
the adoration of saints and holy images and to
multiplied ceremonies. A moral religion, like
that of Persia, of Judea, and of the Teutonic races,
tends to the adoration and service of the unseen.
The Hindoos had innumerable gods, temples, idols.
The Persians worshiped the sacred fire, without
temple, priest, altar, sacrifice, or ritual. The ancient
Persians, wholly unlike the modern Persians,
were a people of action, energy, enterprise. But
when the old Persian empire fell, the character
of the people changed. Just as in Italy the old
Roman type disappeared, and was replaced by the
opposite in the modern Italian, so modern Persia
has swung round to the opposite pole of national
character. The Persians and Turks, both professing
the Mohammedan religion, belong to different
sects of that faith. The Turks are proud, tenacious
of old customs, grave in their demeanor, generally
just in their dealings, keeping their word. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Persians, as they appear in the works of Malcolm
and Monier, are changeable, kindly, polite, given
to ceremonies, fond of poetry, with taste for fine
art and decoration,&mdash;a mobile people. The Turk
is silent, the Persian talkative. The Turk is proud
and cold, the Persian affable and full of sentiment.
In short, the Persian is the Frenchman, and the
Turk the Englishman. And here again, as in the
other cases, the French type of nationality unfolds
itself on the east, and the English on the west.</p>

<p>These national doubles have not been exhausted.
We have other instances of twin nations, born of
much the same confluence of race elements, of
whom, as of Esau and Jacob, it might be predicted
to the mother race, "Two nations shall be born
of thee; two kinds of people shall go forth from
thee; and the one shall be stronger than the
other." Thus there are the twin races which inhabit
Sweden and Norway; the Swedes, on the
east, are more intelligent, quick-witted, and versatile;
the Norwegians, on the west, slow, persistent,
and disposed to foreign conquest and adventure,
as shown in the sea-kings, who discovered Iceland,
Greenland, and Vinland; and the modern
emigrants who reap the vast wheatfields of Minnesota.
So, too, we might speak of the Poles and
Germans. The Polish nation, on the east, resembling
the French; the German, on the west, the
English.</p>

<p>But time will not allow me to carry out these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
parallels into details. The question is, are these
mere coincidences, or do they belong to the homologons
of history, where the same law of progress
repeats itself under different conditions, as the skeleton
of the mammal is found in the whale. Such
curious homologons we find in national events, and
they can hardly be explained as accidental coincidences.
For instance, the English and French
revolutions proceeded by six identical steps. First,
an insurrection of the people. Secondly, the dethronement
and execution of the king. Thirdly,
a military usurper. Fourthly, the old line restored.
Fifthly, after the death of the restored king, his
brother succeeds to the throne. Sixthly, a second
revolution drives the brother into exile, and a constitutional
king of a collateral branch takes his
place.</p>

<p>But if these doubles which I have described
come by some mysterious law of polar force, as in
the magnet, where the two kinds of electricity are
repelled to opposite poles, and yet attract each
other, how account for the regularity of the geographical
position? Why is the French, Greek,
Hindoo, Persian, Italian, Polish, Swedish type always
at the east, and the English, Roman, Iranic,
Ottoman, Spanish, German, Norwegian type always
at the west? Are nations, like tides, affected by
the diurnal revolution of the globe? This, I confess,
I am unable to explain; and I leave it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
others to consider whether what I have described
is pure coincidence, or if it belongs in some way
to the philosophy of history and comes under universal
law.</p>

<h2 title="DID SHAKESPEARE WRITE BACON'S WORKS"><a id="SHAKESPEARE">DID SHAKESPEARE WRITE BACON'S WORKS</a><a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></h2>

<p>The greatest of English poets is Shakespeare.
The greatest prose writer in English literature is
probably Bacon. Each of these writers, alone,
is a marvel of intellectual grandeur. It is hard
to understand how one man, in a few years, could
have written all the masterpieces of Shakespeare,&mdash;thirty-six
dramas, each a work of genius such
as the world will never let die. It is a marvel
that from one mind could proceed the tender
charm of such poems as "Romeo and Juliet,"
"As You Like It," or "The Winter's Tale;"
the wild romance of "The Tempest," or of "A
Midsummer Night's Dream;" the awful tragedies
of "Lear," "Macbeth," and "Othello;" the profound
philosophy of "Hamlet;" the perfect fun
of "Twelfth Night," and "The Merry Wives of
Windsor;" and the reproductions of Roman and
English history. It is another marvel that a man
like Bacon, immersed nearly all his life in business,
a successful lawyer, an ambitious statesman,
a courtier cultivating the society of the sovereign
and the favorites of the sovereign, should also be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
the founder of a new system of philosophy, which
has been the source of many inventions and new
sciences down to the present day; should have critically
surveyed the whole domain of knowledge, and
become a master of English literary style. Each
of these phenomena is a marvel; but put them
together, and assume that one man did it all, and
you have, not a marvel, but a miracle. Yet, this
is the result which the monistic tendency of modern
thought has reached. Several critics of our time
have attempted to show that Bacon, besides writing
all the works usually attributed to him, was also
the author of all of Shakespeare's plays and poems.</p>

<p>This theory was first publicly maintained by
Miss Delia Bacon in 1857. It had been, before,
in 1856, asserted by an Englishman, William
Henry Smith, but only in a small volume printed
for private circulation. This book made a distinguished
convert in the person of Lord Palmerston,
who openly declared his conviction that Bacon was
the author of Shakespeare's plays. Two papers
by Appleton Morgan, written in the same sense,
appeared last year in "Appletons' Journal." But
far the most elaborate and masterly work in support
of this attempt to dethrone Shakespeare, and
to give his seat on the summit of Parnassus to
Lord Bacon, is the book by Judge Holmes, published
in 1866. He has shown much ability, and
brought forward every argument which has any
plausibility connected with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Judge Holmes was, of course, obliged to admit
the extreme antecedent improbability of his position.
Certainly it is very difficult to believe that
the author of such immortal works should have
been willing, for any reason, permanently to conceal
his authorship; or, if he could hide that fact,
should have been willing to give the authorship
to another; or, if willing, should have been able
so effectually to conceal the substitution as to blind
the eyes of all mankind down to the days of Miss
Delia Bacon and Judge Holmes.</p>

<p>What, then, are the arguments used by Judge
Holmes? The proofs he adduces are mainly these:
(1st) That there are many coincidences and parallelisms
of thought and expression between the
works of Bacon and Shakespeare; (2d) that there
is an amount of knowledge and learning in the
plays, which Lord Bacon possessed, but which
Shakespeare could hardly have had. Besides these
principal proofs, there are many other reasons
given which are of inferior weight,&mdash;a phrase in
a letter of Sir Tobie Matthew; another sentence
of Bacon himself, which might be possibly taken
as an admission that he was the author of "Richard
II.;" the fact that some plays which Shakespeare
certainly did not write were first published
with his name or his initials. But his chief argument
is that Shakespeare had neither the learning
nor the time to write the plays, both of which
Lord Bacon possessed; and that there are curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
coincidences between the plays and the prose
works.</p>

<p>These arguments have all been answered, and
the world still believes in Shakespeare as before.
But I have thought it might be interesting to show
how easily another argument could be made of an
exactly opposite kind,&mdash;how easily all these proofs
might be reversed. I am inclined to think that if
we are to believe that one man was the author both
of the plays and of the philosophy, it is much more
probable that Shakespeare wrote the works of
Bacon than that Bacon wrote the works of Shakespeare.
For there is no evidence that Bacon was
a poet as well as a philosopher; but there is ample
evidence that Shakespeare was a philosopher as
well as a poet. This, no doubt, assumes that
Shakespeare actually wrote the plays; but this we
have a right to assume, in the outset of the discussion,
in order to stand on an equal ground with
our opponents.</p>

<p>The Bacon vs. Shakespeare argument runs thus:
"Assuming that Lord Bacon wrote the works
commonly attributed to him, there is reason to
believe that he also wrote the plays and poems
commonly attributed to Shakespeare."</p>

<p>The counter argument would then be: "Assuming
that Shakespeare wrote the plays, and
poems commonly attributed to him, there is reason
to believe that he also wrote the works commonly
attributed to Bacon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
This is clearly the fair basis of the discussion.
What is assumed on the one side on behalf of
Bacon we have a right to assume on the other on
behalf of Shakespeare. But before proceeding on
this basis, I must reply to the only argument of
Judge Holmes which has much apparent weight.
He contends that it was impossible for Shakespeare,
with the opportunities he possessed, to
acquire the knowledge which we find in the plays.
Genius, however great, cannot give the knowledge
of medical and legal terms, nor of the ancient
languages. Now, it has been shown that the plays
afford evidence of a great knowledge of law and
medicine; and of works in Latin and Greek,
French and Italian. How could such information
have been obtained by a boy who had no advantages
of study except at a country grammar
school, which he left at the age of fourteen, who
went to London at twenty-three and became an
actor, and who spent most of his life as actor,
theatrical proprietor, and man of business?</p>

<p>This objection presents difficulties to us, and for
our time, when boys sometimes spend years in the
study of Latin grammar. We cannot understand
the rapidity with which all sorts of knowledge
were imbibed in the period of the Renaissance.
Then every one studied everything. Then Greek
and Latin books were read by prince and peasant,
by queens and generals. Then all sciences and
arts were learned by men and women, by young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
and old. Thus speaks Robert Burton&mdash;who was
forty years old when Shakespeare died: "What
a world of books offers itself, in all subjects, arts
and sciences, to the sweet content and capacity of
the reader! In arithmetic, geometry, perspective,
opticks, astronomy, architecture, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sculptura</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pictura</i>,
of which so many and elaborate treatises
have lately been written; in mechanics and their
mysteries, military matters, navigation, riding of
horses, fencing, swimming, gardening, planting,
great tomes of husbandry, cookery, faulconry,
hunting, fishing, fowling; with exquisite pictures
of all sports and games.... What vast tomes
are extant in law, physic, and divinity, for profit,
pleasure, practice.... Some take an infinite delight
to study the very languages in which these
books were written: Hebrew, Greek, Syriac, Chaldee,
Arabick, and the like." This was the fashion
of that day, to study all languages, all subjects, all
authors. A mind like that of Shakespeare could
not have failed to share this universal desire for
knowledge. After leaving the grammar school, he
had nine years for such studies before he went to
London. As soon as he began to write plays, he
had new motives for study; for the subjects of
the drama in vogue were often taken from classic
story.</p>

<p>But Shakespeare had access to another source
of knowledge besides the study of books. When
he reached London, five or six play-houses were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
full activity, and new plays were produced every
year in vast numbers. New plays were then in
constant demand, just as the new novel and new
daily or weekly paper are called for now. The
drama was the periodical literature of the time.
Dramatic authors wrote with wonderful rapidity,
borrowing their subjects from plays already on the
stage, and from classic or recent history. Marlowe,
Greene, Lyly, Peele, Kyd, Lodge, Nash,
Chettle, Munday, Wilson, were all dramatic writers
before Shakespeare. Philip Henslowe, a manager
or proprietor of the theatres, bought two hundred
and seventy plays in about ten years. Thomas
Heywood wrote a part or the whole of two hundred
and twenty plays during his dramatic career.
Each acted play furnished material for some other.
They were the property of the play-houses, not of
the writers. One writer after another has accused
Shakespeare of indifference to his reputation, because
he did not publish a complete and revised
edition of his works during his life. How could
he do this, since they did not belong to him, but
to the theatre? Yet every writer was at full liberty
to make use of all he could remember of other
plays, as he saw them acted; and Shakespeare
was not slow to use this opportunity. No doubt
he gained knowledge in this way, which he afterward
employed much better than did the authors
from whom he took it.</p>

<p>The first plays printed under Shakespeare's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
name did not appear till he had been connected
with the stage eleven years. This gives time
enough for him to have acquired all the knowledge
to be found in his books. That he had read Latin
and Greek books we are told by Ben Jonson;
though that great scholar undervalued, as was
natural, Shakespeare's attainments in those languages.</p>

<p>But Ben Jonson himself furnishes the best reply
to those who think that Shakespeare could not
have gained much knowledge of science or literature
because he did not go to Oxford or Cambridge.
What opportunities had Ben Jonson?
A bricklayer by trade, called back immediately
from his studies to use the trowel; then running
away and enlisting as a common soldier; fighting
in the Low Countries; coming home at nineteen,
and going on the stage; sent to prison for fighting
a duel&mdash;what opportunities for study had he?
He was of a strong animal nature, combative, in
perpetual quarrels, fond of drink, in pecuniary
troubles, married at twenty, with a wife and children
to support. Yet Jonson was celebrated for
his learning. He was master of Greek and Latin
literature. He took his characters from Athenæus,
Libanius, Philostratus. Somehow he had found
time for all this study. "Greek and Latin thought,"
says Taine, "were incorporated with his own, and
made a part of it. He knew alchemy, and was as
familiar with alembics, retorts, crucibles, etc., as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
he had passed his life in seeking the philosopher's
stone. He seems to have had a specialty in every
branch of knowledge. He had all the methods
of Latin art,&mdash;possessed the brilliant conciseness
of Seneca and Lucan." If Ben Jonson&mdash;a bricklayer,
a soldier, a fighter, a drinker&mdash;could yet find
time to acquire this vast knowledge, is there any
reason why Shakespeare, with much more leisure,
might not have done the like? He did not possess
as much Greek and Latin lore as Ben Jonson,
who, probably, had Shakespeare in his mind when
he wrote the following passage in his "Poetaster:"</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"His learning savors not the school-like gloss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That most consists in echoing words and terms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soonest wins a man an empty name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor any long or far-fetched circumstance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrapt in the curious generalties of art&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a direct and analytic sum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the worth and first effects of art.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for his poesy, ’tis so rammed with life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That it shall gather strength of life with being,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And live hereafter more admired than now."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The only other serious proof offered in support
of the proposition that Bacon wrote the immortal
Shakespearean drama is that certain coincidences
of thought and language are found in the works of
the two writers. When we examine them, however,
they seem very insignificant. Take, as an
example, two or three, on which Judge Holmes
relies, and which he thinks very striking.</p>

<p>Holmes says (page 48) that Bacon quotes Aristotle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
who said that "young men were no fit hearers
of moral philosophy," and Shakespeare says
("Troilus and Cressida"):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"Unlike young men whom Aristotle thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unfit to hear moral philosophy."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">But since Bacon's remark was published in 1605,
and "Troilus and Cressida" did not appear until
1609, Shakespeare might have seen it there, and
introduced it into his play from his recollection of
the passage in the "Advancement of Learning."</p>

<p>Another coincidence mentioned by Holmes is
that both writers use the word "thrust:" Bacon
saying that a ship "thrust into Weymouth;" and
Shakespeare, that "Milan was thrust from Milan."
He also thinks it cannot be an accident that both
frequently use the word "wilderness," though in
very different ways. Both also compare Queen
Elizabeth to a "star." Bacon makes Atlantis an
island in mid-ocean; and the island of Prospero is
also in mid-ocean. Both have a good deal to say
about "mirrors," and "props," and like phrases.</p>

<p>Such reasoning as this has very little weight.
You cannot prove two contemporaneous writings
to have proceeded from one author by the same
words and phrases being found in both; for these
are in the vocabulary of the time, and are the common
property of all who read and write.</p>

<p>My position is that if either of these writers
wrote the works attributed to the other, it is much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
more likely that Shakespeare wrote the philosophical
works of Bacon than that Bacon wrote the
poetical works of Shakespeare. Assuming then,
as we have a right to do in this argument, that
Shakespeare wrote the plays, what reasons are there
for believing that he also wrote the philosophy?</p>

<p>First, this assumption will explain at once that
hitherto insoluble problem of the contradiction
between Bacon's character and conduct and his
works. How could he have been, at the same
time, what Pope calls <span class="locked">him,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"The wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind"?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">He was, in his philosophy, the leader of his age,
the reformer of old abuses, the friend of progress.
In his conduct, he was, as Macaulay has shown,
"far behind his age,&mdash;far behind Sir Edward
Coke; clinging to exploded abuses, withstanding
the progress of improvement, struggling to push
back the human mind." In his writings, he was
calm, dignified, noble. In his life, he was an
office-seeker through long years, seeking place by
cringing subservience to men in power, made
wretched to the last degree when office was denied
him, addressing servile supplications to noblemen
and to the sovereign. To gain and keep office he
would desert his friends, attack his benefactors,
and make abject apologies for any manly word he
might have incautiously uttered. His philosophy
rose far above earth and time, and sailed supreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
in the air of universal reason. But "his desires
were set on things below. Wealth, precedence,
titles, patronage, the mace, the seals, the coronet,
large houses, fair gardens, rich manors, massy services
of plate, gay hangings," were "objects for
which he stooped to everything and endured everything."
These words of Macaulay have been
thought too severe. But we defy any admirer of
Bacon to read his life, by Spedding, without admitting
their essential truth. How was it possible
for a man to spend half of his life in the meanest
of pursuits, and the other half in the noblest?</p>

<p>This difficulty is removed if we suppose that
Bacon, the courtier and lawyer, with his other
ambitions, was desirous of the fame of a great philosopher;
and that he induced Shakespeare, then
in the prime of his powers, to help him write the
prose essays and treatises which are his chief
works. He has himself admitted that he did actually
ask the aid of the dramatists of his time in
writing his books. This remarkable fact is stated
by Bacon in a letter to Tobie Matthew, written in
June, 1623, in which he says that he is devoting
himself to making his writings more perfect&mdash;instancing
the "Essays" and the "Advancement
of Learning"&mdash;"by the help of some good pens,
which forsake me not." One of these pens was
that of Ben Jonson, the other might easily have
been that of Shakespeare. Certainly there was no
better pen in England at that time than his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
When Shakespeare's plays were being produced,
Lord Bacon was fully occupied in his law practice,
his parliamentary duties, and his office-seeking.
The largest part of the Shakespeare drama was put
on the stage, as modern research renders probable,
in the ten or twelve years beginning with 1590. In
1597 Shakespeare was rich enough to buy the new
place at Stratford-on-Avon, and was also lending
money. In 1604 he was part owner of the Globe
Theatre, so that the majority of the plays which
gained for him this fortune must have been produced
before that time. Now, these were just the
busiest years of Bacon's life. In 1584 he was
elected to Parliament. About the same time, he
wrote his famous letter to Queen Elizabeth. In
1585 he was already seeking office from Walsingham
and Burleigh. In 1586 he sat in Parliament
for Taunton, and was active in debate and on committees.
He became a bencher in the same year,
and began to plead in the courts of Westminster.
In 1589 he became queen's counsel, and member
of Parliament for Liverpool. After this he continued
active, both in Parliament and at the bar.
He sought, by the help of Essex, to become Attorney-General.
From that period, as crown lawyer,
his whole time and thought were required to trace
and frustrate the conspiracies with which the kingdom
was full. It was evident that during these
years he had no time to compose fifteen or twenty
of the greatest works in any literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
But how was Shakespeare occupied when Bacon's
philosophy appeared? The "Advancement of
Learning" was published in 1605, after most of
the plays had been written, as we learn from the
fact of Shakespeare's purchase of houses and
lands. The "Novum Organum" was published in
1620, after Shakespeare's death. But it had been
written years before; revised, altered, and copied
again and again&mdash;it is said twelve times. Bacon
had been engaged upon it during thirty years, and
it was at last published incomplete and in fragments.
If Shakespeare assisted in the composition
of this work, his death in 1616 would account,
at once, for its being left unfinished. And Shakespeare
would have had ample time to furnish the
ideas of the "Organum" in the last years of his
life, when he had left the theatre. In 1613 he
bought a house in Black Friars, where Ben Jonson
also lived. Might not this have been that they
might more conveniently coöperate in assisting
Bacon to write the "Novum Organum"?</p>

<p>When we ask whether it would have been easier
for the author of the philosophy to have composed
the drama, or the dramatic poet to have written
the philosophy, the answer will depend on which
is the greater work of the two. The greater includes
the less, but the less cannot include the
greater. Now, the universal testimony of modern
criticism in England, Germany, and France declares
that no larger, deeper, or ampler intellect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
has ever appeared than that which produced the
Shakespeare drama. This "myriad-minded" poet
was also philosopher, man of the world, acquainted
with practical affairs, one of those who saw the
present and foresaw the future. All the ideas of
the Baconian philosophy might easily have had
their home in this vast intelligence. Great as
are the thoughts of the "Novum Organum," they
are far inferior to that world of thought which is
in the drama. We can easily conceive that Shakespeare,
having produced in his prime the wonders
and glories of the plays, should in his after leisure
have developed the leading ideas of the Baconian
philosophy. But it is difficult to imagine that
Bacon, while devoting his main strength to politics,
to law, and to philosophy, should as a mere
pastime for his leisure, have produced in his idle
moments the greatest intellectual work ever done
on earth.</p>

<p>If the greater includes the less, the mind of
Shakespeare includes that of Bacon, and not <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice
versa</i>. This will appear more plainly if we consider
the quality of intellect displayed respectively
in the dramas and the philosophy. The one is
synthetic, creative; the other analytic, critical.
The one puts together, the other takes apart and
examines. Now, the genius which can put together
can also take apart; but it by no means
follows that the power of taking apart implies that
of putting together. A watch-maker, who can put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
a watch together, can easily take it to pieces; but
many a child who has taken his watch to pieces
has found it impossible to put it together again.</p>

<p>When we compare the Shakespeare plays and
the Baconian philosophy, it is curious to see how
the one is throughout a display of the synthetic
intellect, and the other of the analytic. The plays
are pure creation, the production of living wholes.
They people our thought with a race of beings
who are living persons, and not pale abstractions.
These airy nothings take flesh and form, and have
a name and local habitation forever on the earth.
Hamlet, Desdemona, Othello, Miranda, are as real
people as Queen Elizabeth or Mary of Scotland.
But when we turn to the Baconian philosophy, this
faculty is absent. We have entered the laboratory
of a great chemist, and are surrounded by retorts
and crucibles, tests and re-agents, where the work
done is a careful analysis of all existing things, to
find what are their constituents and their qualities.
Poetry creates, philosophy takes to pieces and examines.</p>

<p>It is, I think, a historic fact, that while those
authors whose primary quality is poetic genius
have often been also, on a lower plane, eminent
as philosophers, there is, perhaps, not a single
instance of one whose primary distinction was
philosophic analysis, who has also been, on a
lower plane, eminent as a poet. Milton, Petrarch,
Goethe, Lucretius, Voltaire, Coleridge, were primarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
and eminently poets; but all excelled, too,
in a less degree, as logicians, metaphysicians, men
of science, and philosophers. But what instance
have we of any man like Bacon, chiefly eminent
as lawyer, statesman, and philosopher, who was
also distinguished, though in a less degree, as a
poet? Among great lawyers, is there one eminent
also as a dramatic or lyric author? Cicero tried
it, but his verses are only doggerel. In Lord
Campbell's list of the lord chancellors and chief
justices of England no such instance appears. If
Bacon wrote the Shakespeare drama, he is the one
exception to an otherwise universal rule. But if
Shakespeare coöperated in the production of the
Baconian philosophy, he belongs to a class of poets
who have done the same. Coleridge was one of
the most imaginative of poets. His "Christabel"
and "Ancient Mariner" are pure creations. But
in later life he originated a new system of philosophy
in England, the influence of which has not
ceased to be felt to our day. The case would be
exactly similar if we suppose that Shakespeare,
having ranged the realm of imaginative poetry in
his youth, had in his later days of leisure coöperated
with Bacon and Ben Jonson in producing
the "Advancement of Learning" and the "Novum
Organum." We can easily think of them
as meeting, sometimes at the house of Ben Jonson,
sometimes at that of Shakespeare in Black Friars,
and sometimes guests at that private house built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
by Lord Bacon for purposes of study, near his
splendid palace of Gorhambury. "A most ingeniously
contrived house," says Basil Montagu,
"where, in the society of his philosophical friends,
he devoted himself to study and meditation."
Aubrey tells us that he had the aid of Hobbes in
writing down his thoughts. Lord Bacon appears to
have possessed the happy gift of using other men's
faculties in his service. Ben Jonson, who had
been a thorough student of chemistry, alchemy,
and science in all the forms then known, aided
Bacon in his observations of nature. Hobbes
aided him in giving clearness to his thoughts
and his language. And from Shakespeare he may
have derived the radical and central ideas of his
philosophy. He used the help of Dr. Playfer to
translate his philosophy into Latin. Tobie Matthew
gives him the last argument of Galileo for
the Copernican system. He sends his works to
others, begging them to correct the thoughts and
the style. It is evident, then, that he would have
been glad of the concurrence of Shakespeare, and
that could easily be had, through their common
friend, Ben Jonson.</p>

<p>If Bacon wrote the plays of Shakespeare, it is
difficult to give any satisfactory reason for his concealment
of that authorship. He had much pride,
not to say vanity, in being known as an author.
He had his name attached to all his other works,
and sent them as presents to the universities, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
to individuals, with letters calling their attention
to these books. Would he have been willing permanently
to conceal the fact of his being the author
of the best poetry of his time? The reasons assigned
by Judge Holmes for this are not satisfactory.
They are: his desire to rise in the profession
of the law, the low reputation of a play-writer, his
wish to write more freely under an incognito, and
his wish to rest his reputation on his philosophical
works. But if he were reluctant to be regarded
as the author of "Lear" and "Hamlet," he was
willing to be known as the writer of "Masques,"
and a play about "Arthur," exhibited by the students
of Gray's Inn. It is an error to say that
the reputation of a play-writer was low. Judge
Holmes, himself, tells us that there was nothing
remarkable in a barrister of the inns of court writing
for the stage. Ford and Beaumont were both
lawyers as well as eminent play-writers. Lord
Backhurst, Lord Brooke, Sir Henry Wotton, all
wrote plays. And we find nothing in the Shakespeare
dramas which Bacon need have feared to
say under his own name. It would have been
ruin to Sir Philip Francis to have avowed himself
the author of "Junius." But the Shakespeare
plays satirized no one, and made no enemies. If
there were any reasons for concealment, they certainly
do not apply to the year 1623, when the
first folio appeared, which was after the death
of Shakespeare and the fall of Bacon. The acknowledgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
of their authorship at that time
could no longer interfere with Bacon's rise. And
it would be very little to the credit of his intelligence
to assume that he was not then aware of the
value of such works, or that he did not desire
the reputation of being their author. It would
have been contrary to his very nature not to have
wished for the credit of that authorship.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there would be nothing
surprising in the fact of Shakespeare's laying no
claim to credit for having assisted in the composition
of the "Advancement of Learning." Shakespeare
was by nature as reticent and modest as
Bacon was egotistical and ostentatious. What
a veil is drawn over the poet's personality in his
sonnets! We read in them his inmost sentiments,
but they tell us absolutely nothing of the events of
his life, or the facts of his position. And if, as
we assume, he was one among several who helped
Lord Bacon, though he might have done the most,
there was no special reason why he should proclaim
that fact.</p>

<p>Gervinus has shown, in three striking pages, the
fundamental harmony between the ideas and mental
tendencies of Shakespeare and Bacon. Their
philosophy of man and of life was the same. If,
then, Bacon needed to be helped in thinking out
his system, there was no one alive who would have
given him such stimulus and encouragement as
Shakespeare. This also may explain his not mentioning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
the name of Shakespeare in his works;
for that might have called too much attention to
the source from which he received this important
aid.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I regard the monistic theory as in
the last degree improbable. We have two great
authors, and not one only. But if we are compelled
to accept the view which ascribes a common
source to the Shakespeare drama and the Baconian
philosophy, I think there are good reasons for
preferring Shakespeare to Bacon as the author
of both. When the plays appeared, Bacon was
absorbed in pursuits and ambitions foreign to such
work; his accepted writings show no sign of such
creative power; he was the last man in the world
not to take the credit of such a success, and had
no motive to conceal his authorship. On the other
hand, there was a period in Shakespeare's life
when he had abundant leisure to coöperate in the
literary plans of Bacon; his ample intellect was
full of the ideas which took form in those works;
and he was just the person neither to claim nor to
desire any credit for lending such assistance.</p>

<p>There is, certainly, every reason to believe that,
among his other ambitions, Bacon desired that of
striking out a new path of discovery, and initiating
a better method in the study of nature. But
we know that, in doing this, he sought aid in
all quarters, and especially among Shakespeare's
friends and companions. It is highly probable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
therefore, that he became acquainted with the
great dramatist, and that Shakespeare knew of
Bacon's designs and became interested in them.
And if so, who could offer better suggestions than
he; and who would more willingly accept them
than the overworked statesman and lawyer, who
wished to be also a philosopher?</p>

<p>Finally, we may refer those who believe that the
shape of the brow and head indicates the quality
of mental power to the portraits of the two men.
The head of Shakespeare, according to all the
busts and pictures which remain to us, belongs
to the type which antiquity has transmitted to us
in the portraits of Homer and Plato. In this vast
dome of thought there was room for everything.
The head of Bacon is also a grand one, but less
ample, less complete&mdash;less</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem" xml:lang="la" lang="la">
<span class="i0q">"Teres, totus atque rotundus."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">These portraits therefore agree with all we know
of the writings, in showing us which, and which
only, of the two minds was capable of containing
the other.</p>

<h2 title="THE EVOLUTION OF A GREAT POEM"><a id="EVOLUTION">THE EVOLUTION OF A GREAT POEM</a><a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></h2>

<p>There are at least three existing manuscripts
of Grays "Elegy," in the author's autograph.
The earliest, containing the largest number of
variations and the most curious, is that now in the
possession of Sir William Fraser in London, and
for which he paid the large sum of £230, in 1875.
By the kindness of Sir William Fraser, I examined
this manuscript at his rooms in London, in 1882.
A facsimile copy of this valuable autograph, photographed
from the original in 1862, is now before
me. A second copy in the handwriting of Gray,
called the Pembroke manuscript, is in the library
of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge. A facsimile of
this autograph appears in Matthias's edition of
Mason's "Gray," published in 1814. A third
copy, in the poet's handwriting, copied by him for
his friend, Dr. Wharton, is in the British Museum.
I examined this, also, in 1882, and had an accurate
copy made for me by one of the assistants
in the museum. This was written after the other
two, as is evident from the fact that it approaches
most nearly to the form which the "Elegy" finally
assumed when printed. There are only nine or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
ten expressions in this manuscript which differ
from the poem as published by Gray. Most of
these are unimportant. "<em>Or</em>" he changed, in
three places, into "and." "<em>And</em> in our ashes"
he changed into "Even in our ashes," which was
a clear improvement. It was not until after this
third copy was written that the improvement was
made which changed</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"Forgive, ye Proud, the involuntary Fault,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Memory to These no Trophies raise,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">into</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"Nor you, ye proud, impute to these the fault,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Memory o'er their tomb no trophies raise."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Another important alteration of a single word was
also made after this third manuscript was written.
This was the change, in the forty-fifth stanza, of
"Reins of Empire" into "Rod of Empire."</p>

<p>"The Elegy in a Country Churchyard" became
at once one of the most popular poems in the
language, and has remained so to this time. It
has been equally a favorite with common readers,
with literary men, and with poets. Its place will
always be in the highest rank of English poetry.
The fact, however, is&mdash;and it is a very curious
fact&mdash;that this first-class poem was the work of a
third-class poet. For Thomas Gray certainly does
not stand in the first class with Shakespeare,
Spenser, and Milton. Nor can he fairly be put in
the second class with Dryden, Pope, Burns, Wordsworth,
and Byron. He belongs to the third, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
Cowley, Cowper, Shelley, and Keats. There may
be a doubt concerning some of whom I have
named, but there can be no doubt that Gray will
never stand higher than those who may be placed
by critics in the third class. Yet it is equally
certain that he has produced a first-class poem.
How is this paradox to be explained?</p>

<p>What is the charm of Gray's "Elegy"? The
thoughts are sufficiently commonplace. That all
men must die, that the most humble may have had
in them some power which, under other circumstances,
might have made them famous,&mdash;these
are somewhat trite statements; but the fascination
of the verses consists in the tone, solemn but
serene, which pervades them; in the pictures of
coming night, of breaking day, of cheerful rural
life, of happy homes; and lastly, in the perfect
finish of the verse and the curious felicity of the
diction. In short, the poem is a work of high art.
It was not inspired, but it was carefully elaborated.
And this appears plainly when we compare
it, as it stands in the Fraser manuscript, with
its final form.</p>

<p>This poem was a work of eight years. Its heading
in the Fraser manuscript is "Stanzas Wrote
in a Country Churchyard." It was, however, begun
at Stoke in 1742, continued at Cambridge,
and had its last touches added at Stoke-Pogis,
June 12, 1750. In a letter to Horace Walpole of
that date, Gray says, "Having put an end to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
thing whose beginning you saw long ago, I immediately
send it to you."</p>

<p>The corrections made by Gray during this
period were many, and were probably all improvements.
Many poets when they try to improve
their verses only injure them. But Gray's corrections
were invariably for the better. We may
even say that, if it had been published as it was
first written, and as it now stands in the Fraser
manuscript, it would have ranked only with the
best poetry of Shenstone or Cowper. Let me
indicate some of the most important changes.</p>

<p>In line seventeen, the fine epithet of "incense-breathing"
was an addition.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">

</div></div>

<p class="in0">Nineteenth line, Fraser manuscript <span class="locked">has&mdash;</span></p>

</div></div>

<p>Twenty-fourth&mdash;"Coming kiss" was corrected
to "envied kiss."</p>

<p>Forty-third&mdash;"Awake the silent dust" was
corrected to "provoke the silent dust."</p>

<p>Forty-seventh&mdash;The correction of "Reins of
Empire" to "Rod of Empire" first appears in
the margin of the Pembroke manuscript.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Fifty-seventh&mdash;In the Fraser manuscript it
<span class="locked">reads&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"Some village Cato, who with dauntless breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some mute, inglorious Tully here may rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some Cæsar," etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">In the Pembroke manuscript, these classical personages
have disappeared, and the great improvement
was made of substituting Hampden, Milton,
and Cromwell, and thus maintaining the English
coloring of the poem.</p>

<p>Fifty-first&mdash;This verse, beginning, "But Knowledge,"
etc., was placed, in the Fraser manuscript,
after the one beginning, "Some village Cato," but
with a note in the margin to transfer it to where
it now stands. The third line of the stanza was
first written, "Chill Penury had damped." This
was first corrected to "depressed," and afterward
to "repressed."</p>

<p>Fifty-fifth&mdash;"Their fate forbade," changed to
"Their lot forbade."</p>

<p>Sixty-sixth&mdash;"Their struggling virtues" was
improved to "Their growing virtues."</p>

<p>Seventy-first&mdash;"Crown the shrine" was altered
to "heap the shrine," and in the next line "Incense
hallowed by the muse's flame" was wisely
changed to "Incense kindled by the muse's flame."</p>

<p>After the seventy-second line stand, in the
Fraser manuscript, the following stanzas, which
Gray, with admirable taste, afterward omitted.
But, before he decided to leave them out altogether,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
he drew a black line down the margin,
indicating that he would transfer them to another
place. These stanzas were originally intended to
close the poem. Afterward the thought occurred
to him of "the hoary-headed swain" and the
"Epitaph."</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">

</div>
</div></div>

<p>After these stanzas, according to the Fraser
manuscript, were to follow these lines, which I do
not remember to have seen <span class="locked">elsewhere:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"If chance that e'er some pensive Spirit more,<br /></span>

<span class="i0q">"Haply," etc.<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>But Gray soon dispensed with this feeble stanza,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
and made a new one by changing it into the one
<span class="locked">beginning:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"For thee, who mindful."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">The ninety-ninth and one hundredth lines stand in

<span class="i0q">"With hasty footsteps brush the dews away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the high brow of yonder hanging lawn."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The following stanza is noticeable for the inversions
so frequent in Gray, and which he had,
perhaps, unconsciously adopted from his familiarity
with the classics. He afterward omitted <span class="locked">it:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"Him have we seen the greenwood side along,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">With wistful eyes pursue the setting sun."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">In the manuscript the word is spelled "whistful."
In line 101, "hoary beech" is corrected to "spreading
beech," and afterward to "nodding beech."</p>

<p>Line 113&mdash;"Dirges meet" was changed to
"dirges dire;" and after 116 came the beautiful
stanza, afterward omitted by Gray as being <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de trop</i>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">

<span class="i2">And little footsteps lightly print the ground."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Even in this verse there were two corrections.
"Robin" was altered in the Fraser manuscript
into "redbreast," and "frequent violets" into
"showers of violets."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
One of the most curious accidents to which this
famous poem has been subjected was an erroneous
change made in the early editions, which has been
propagated almost to our time. In the stanza <span class="locked">beginning&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"The boast of Heraldry, the pomp of Power,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Gray wrote</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"Awaits alike the inevitable Hour."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">And so it stands in all three manuscripts, and in
the printed edition which he himself superintended.
His meaning was, "The inevitable Hour awaits
everything. It stands there, waiting the boast
of Heraldry," etc. But his editors, misled by his
inverted style, supposed that it was the gifts of
Heraldry, Power, Beauty, etc., that were waiting,
and therefore corrected what they thought Gray's
bad grammar, and printed the word "await." But
so they destroyed the meaning. These things were
not waiting at all for the dread hour; they were
enjoying themselves, careless of its approach.
But "the hour" was waiting for them. Gray's

<p>In tracing the development of this fine poem, we
see it gradually improving under his careful touch,
till it becomes a work of high art. In some poets&mdash;Wordsworth,
for example&mdash;inspiration is at
its maximum, and art at its minimum. In Gray,
I think, inspiration was at its minimum, and art at
its maximum.</p>

<p>It has long been known that many analogies
exist between Buddhism and Christianity. The
ceremonies, ritual, and rites of the Buddhists strikingly
resemble those of the Roman Catholic Church.
The Buddhist priests are monks. They take the
same three vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience
which are binding on those of the Roman Church.
They are mendicants, like the mendicant orders of
St. Francis and St. Dominic. They are tonsured;
use strings of beads, like the rosary, with which to
count their prayers; have incense and candles in
their worship; use fasts, processions, litanies, and
holy water. They have something akin to the
adoration of saints; repeat prayers in an unknown
tongue; have a chanted psalmody with a double
choir; and suspend the censer from five chains.
In China, some Buddhists worship the image of a
virgin, called the Queen of Heaven, having an
infant in her arms, and holding a cross. In Thibet
the Grand Lamas wear a mitre, dalmatica, and
cope, and pronounce a benediction on the laity by
extending the right hand over their heads. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Dalai-Lama resembles the Pope, and is regarded
as the head of the Church. The worship of relics
is very ancient among the Buddhists, and so are
pilgrimages to sacred places.</p>

<p>Besides these resemblances in outward ceremonies,
more important ones appear in the inner life
and history of the two religions. Both belong to
those systems which derive their character from a
human founder, and not from a national tendency;
to the class which contains the religions of Moses,
Zoroaster, Confucius, and Mohammed, and not to
that in which the Brahmanical, Egyptian, Scandinavian,
Greek, and Roman religions are found.
Both Buddhism and Christianity are catholic, and
not ethnic; that is, not confined to a single race
or nation, but by their missionary spirit passing
beyond these boundaries, and making converts
among many races. Christianity began among the
Jews as a Semitic religion, but, being rejected by
the Jewish nation, established itself among the
Aryan races of Europe. In the same way Buddhism,
beginning among an Aryan people&mdash;the
Hindoos&mdash;was expelled from Hindostan, and established
itself among the Mongol races of Eastern
Asia. Besides its resemblances to the Roman
Catholic side of Christendom, Buddhism has still
closer analogies with the Protestant Church. Like
Protestantism, it is a reform, which rejects a hierarchal
system and does away with a priestly caste.
Like Protestantism, it has emphasized the purely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
humane side of life, and is a religion of humanity
rather than of piety. Both the Christian and Buddhist
churches teach a divine incarnation, and both
worship a God-man.</p>

<p>Are these remarkable analogies only casual resemblances,
or are they real affinities? By affinity
we here mean genetic relationship. Are Buddhism
and Christianity related as mother and child, one
being derived from the other; or are they related by
both being derived from some common ancestor? Is
either derived from the other, as Christianity from
Judaism, or Protestantism from the Papal Church?
That there can be no such affinity as this seems
evident from history. History shows no trace of
the contact which would be required for such influence.
If Christianity had taken its customs from
Buddhism, or Buddhism from Christianity, there
must have been ample historic evidence of the fact.
But, instead of this, history shows that each has
grown up by its own natural development, and has
unfolded its qualities separately and alone. The
law of evolution also teaches that such great systems
do not come from imitation, but as growths from a
primal germ.</p>

<p>Nor does history give the least evidence of a common
ancestry from which both took their common
traits. We know that Buddhism was derived from
Brahmanism, and that Christianity was derived
from Judaism. Now, Judaism and Brahmanism
have few analogies; they could not, therefore, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
transmitted to their offspring what they did not
themselves possess. Brahmanism came from an
Aryan stock, in Central Asia; Judaism from a
Semitic stem, thousands of miles to the west. If
Buddhism and Christianity came from a common
source, that source must have antedated both the
Mosaic and Brahmanical systems. Even then it
would be a case of atavism in which the original
type disappeared in the children, to reappear in the
later descendants.</p>

<p>Are, then, these striking resemblances, and others
which are still to be mentioned, only accidental
analogies? This does not necessarily follow; for
there is a third alternative. They may be what
are called in science homologies; that is, the same
law working out similar results under the same
conditions, though under different circumstances.
The whale lives under different circumstances from
other mammalia; but being a mammal, he has a
like osseous structure. What seems to be a fin,
being dissected, turns out to be an arm, with hand
and fingers. There are like homologies in history.
Take the instance of the English and French revolutions.
In each case the legitimate king was
tried, condemned, and executed. A republic followed.
The republic gave way before a strong-handed
usurper. Then the original race of kings
was restored; but, having learned nothing and forgotten
nothing, they were displaced a second time,
and a constitutional monarch placed on the throne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
who, though not the legitimate king, still belonged
to the same race. Here the same laws of human
nature have worked out similar results; for no one
would suggest that France had copied its revolutions
from England. And, in religion, human nature
reproduces similar customs and ceremonies
under like conditions. When, for instance, you
have a mechanical system of prayer, in which the
number of prayers is of chief importance, there
must be some way of counting them, and so the
rosary has been invented independently in different
religions. We have no room to point out how
this law has worked in other instances; but it is
enough to refer to the principle.</p>

<p>Besides these resemblances between Buddhism
and Christianity, there are also some equally remarkable
differences, which should be noticed.</p>

<p>The first of these is the striking fact that Buddhism
has been unable to recognize the existence of
the Infinite Being. It has been called atheism by
the majority of the best authorities. Even Arthur
Lillie, who defends this system from the charge of
agnosticism, <span class="locked">says:<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> "An agnostic school of Buddhism
without doubt exists. It professes plain atheism,
and holds that every mortal, when he escapes
from re-births, and the causation of Karma by the
awakenment of the Bodhi or gnosis, will be annihilated.
This Buddhism, by Eugène Burnouf,
Saint-Hilaire, Max Müller, Csoma de Körös, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
I believe, almost every writer of note, is pronounced
the original Buddhism,&mdash;the Buddhism
of the South." Almost every writer of note,
therefore, who has studied Buddhism in the Pâli,
Singhalese, Chinese, and other languages, and has
had direct access to its original sources, has pronounced
it a system of atheism. But this opinion
is opposed to the fact that Buddhists have everywhere
worshiped unseen and superhuman powers,
erected magnificent temples, maintained an elaborate
ritual, and adored Buddha as the supreme
ruler of the worlds. How shall we explain this
paradox? All depends on the definition we give
to the word "atheism." If a system is atheistic
which sees only the temporal, and not the eternal;
which knows no God as the author, creator, and
ruler of Nature; which ascribes the origin of the
universe to natural causes, to which only the finite
is knowable, and the infinite unknowable&mdash;then
Buddhism is atheism. But, in that case, much
of the polytheism of the world must be regarded
as atheism; for polytheism has largely worshiped
finite gods. The whole race of Olympian deities
were finite beings. Above them ruled the everlasting
necessity of things. But who calls the
Greek worshipers atheists? The Buddha, to most
Buddhists, is a finite being, one who has passed
through numerous births, has reached Nirvana, and
will one day be superseded by another Buddha.
Yet, for the time, he is the Supreme Being, Ruler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
of all the Worlds. He is the object of worship,
and really divine, if in a subordinate sense.</p>

<p>I would not, therefore, call this religion atheism.
No religion which worships superhuman powers
can justly be called atheistic on account of its
meagre metaphysics. How many Christians there
are who do not fully realize the infinite and eternal
nature of the Deity! To many He is no more than
the Buddha is to his worshipers,&mdash;a supreme being,
a mighty ruler, governing all things by his
will. How few see God everywhere in nature, as
Jesus saw Him, letting his sun shine on the evil and
good, and sending his rain on the just and unjust.
How few see Him in all of life, so that not a sparrow
dies, or a single hair of the head falls, without
the Father. Most Christians recognize the Deity
only as occasionally interfering by special providences,
particular judgments, and the like.</p>

<p>But in Christianity this ignorance of the eternal
nature of God is the exception, while in Buddhism
it is the rule. In the reaction against Brahmanism,
the Brahmanic faith in the infinite was lost.
In the fully developed system of the ancient Hindoo
religion the infinite overpowered the finite, the
temporal world was regarded as an illusion, and
only the eternal was real. The reaction from this
extreme was so complete as to carry the Buddhists
to the exact opposite. If to the Brahman all the
finite visible world was only <i>maya</i>&mdash;illusion, to
the Buddhists all the infinite unseen world was unknowable,
and practically nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Perhaps the most original feature of Christianity
is the fact that it has combined in a living synthesis
that which in other systems was divided.
Jesus regarded love to God and love to man as
identical,&mdash;positing a harmonious whole of time
and eternity, piety and humanity, faith and works,&mdash;and
thus laid the foundation of a larger system
than either Brahmanism or Buddhism. He did
not invent piety, nor discover humanity. Long
before he came the Brahmanic literature had
sounded the deepest depths of spiritual life, and
the Buddhist missionaries had preached universal
benevolence to mankind. But the angelic hymn
which foretold the new religion as bringing at once
"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace,
good will to men" indicated the essence of the
faith which was at the same time a heavenly love
and an earthly blessing. This difference of result
in the two systems came probably from the different
methods of their authors. With Jesus life was
the source of knowledge; the life was the light of
men. With the Buddha, reflection, meditation,
thought was the source of knowledge. In this,
however, he included intuition no less than reflection.
Sakya-muni understood perfectly that a mere
intellectual judgment possessed little motive power;
therefore he was not satisfied till he had obtained
an intuitive perception of truth. That alone gave
at once rest and power. But as the pure intellect,
even in its highest act, is unable to grasp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
the infinite, the Buddha was an agnostic on this
side of his creed by the very success of his method.
Who, by searching, can find out God? The infinite
can only be known by the process of living
experience. This was the method of Jesus, and
has been that of his religion. For what is faith
but that receptive state of mind which waits on
the Lord to receive the illumination which it cannot
create by its own processes? However this
may be, it is probable that the fatal defect in
Buddhism which has neutralized its generous philanthropy
and its noble humanities has been the
absence of the inspiration which comes from the
belief in an eternal world. Man is too great to be
satisfied with time alone, or eternity alone; he
needs to live from and for both. Hence, Buddhism
is an arrested religion, while Christianity is
progressive. Christianity has shown the capacity
of outgrowing its own defects and correcting its
own mistakes. For example, it has largely outgrown
its habit of persecuting infidels and heretics.
No one is now put to death for heresy. It
has also passed out of the stage in which religion
is considered to consist in leaving the world and
entering a monastery. The anchorites of the early
centuries are no longer to be found in Christendom.
Even in Catholic countries the purpose of
monastic life is no longer to save the soul by ascetic
tortures, but to attain some practical end.
The Protestant Reformation, which broke the yoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
of priestly power and set free the mind of Europe,
was a movement originating in Christianity itself,
like other developments of a similar kind. No
such signs of progress exist in the system of Buddhism.
It has lost the missionary ardor of its early
years; it has ceased from creating a vast literature
such as grew up in its younger days; it no longer
produces any wonders of architecture. It even
lags behind the active life of the countries where
it has its greatest power.</p>

<p>It is a curious analogy between the two systems
that, while neither the Christ nor the Buddha practiced
or taught asceticism, their followers soon
made the essence of religion to consist in some
form of monastic life. Both Jesus and Sakya-muni
went about doing good. Both sent their followers
into the world to preach a gospel. Jesus,
after thirty years of a retired life, came among
men "eating and drinking," and associating with
"publicans and sinners." Sakya-muni, after
spending some years as an anchorite, deliberately
renounced that mode of religion as unsatisfactory,
and associated with all men, as Jesus afterward
did. Within a few centuries after their death,
their followers relapsed into ascetic and monastic
practices; but with this difference, that while in
Christendom there has always been both a regular
and a secular clergy, in the Buddhist countries
the whole priesthood live in monasteries. They
have no parish priests, unless as an exception.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
While in Christian countries the clergy has become
more and more a practical body, in sympathy
with the common life, in Buddhist lands they live
apart and exercise little influence on the civil condition
of the people.</p>

<p>Nor must we pass by the important fact that the
word Christendom is synonymous with a progressive
civilization, while Buddhism is everywhere
connected with one which is arrested and stationary.
The boundaries of the Christian religion are
exactly coextensive with the advance of science,
art, literature; and with the continued accumulation
of knowledge, power, wealth, and the comforts
of human life. According to <span class="locked">Kuenen,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span> one of the
most recent students of these questions, this difference
is due to the principle of hope which exists in
Christianity, but is absent in Buddhism. The one
has always believed in a kingdom of God here and
a blessed immortality hereafter. Buddhism has
not this hope; and this, says Kuenen, "is a blank
which nothing can fill." So large a thinker as
Albert Réville has expressed his belief that even
the intolerance of Christianity indicated a passionate
love of truth which has created modern science.
He says that "if Europe had not passed through
those ages of intolerance, it is doubtful whether the
science of our day would ever have <span class="locked">arrived."<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> It
is only within the boundaries of nations professing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
the Christian faith that we must go to-day to learn
the latest discoveries in science, the best works of
art, the most flourishing literature. Only within
the same circle of Christian states is there a government
by law, and not by will. Only within
these boundaries have the rights of the individual
been secured, while the power of the state has been
increased. Government by law, joined with personal
freedom, is only to be found where the faith
exists which teaches that God not only supports the
universal order of natural things, but is also the
friend of the individual soul; and in just that circle
of states in which the doctrine is taught that there
is no individual soul for God to love and no Divine
presence in the order of nature, human life has subsided
into apathy, progress has ceased, and it has
been found impossible to construct national unity.
Saint-Hilaire <span class="locked">affirms<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> that "in politics and legislation
the dogma of Buddhism has remained inferior
even to that of Brahmanism," and "has been able
to do nothing to constitute states or to govern them
by equitable rules." These Buddhist nations are
really six: Siam, Burma, Nepaul, Thibet, Tartary,
and Ceylon. The activity and social progress in
China and Japan are no exceptions to this rule;
for in neither country has Buddhism any appreciable
influence on the character of the people.</p>

<p>To those who deny that the theology of a people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
influences its character, it may be instructive to
see how exactly the good and evil influences of
Buddhism correspond to the positive and negative
traits of its doctrine. Its merits, says Saint-Hilaire,
are its practical character, its abnegation
of vulgar gratifications, its benevolence, mildness,
sentiment of human equality, austerity of manners,
dislike of falsehood, and respect for the family.
Its defects are want of social power, egotistical
aims, ignorance of the ideal good, of the sense
of human right and human freedom, skepticism, incurable
despair, contempt of life. All its human
qualities correspond to its doctrinal teaching from
the beginning. It has always taught benevolence,
patience, self-denial, charity, and toleration. Its
defects arise inevitably from its negative aim,&mdash;to
get rid of sorrow and evil by sinking into apathy,
instead of seeking for the triumph of good and the
coming of a reign of God here on the earth.</p>

<p>As regards the Buddha himself, modern students
differ widely. Some, of course, deny his very
existence, and reduce him to a solar myth. M.
Emile Senart, as quoted by <span class="locked">Oldenberg,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span> following
the Lalita Vistara as his authority, makes of him
a solar hero, born of the morning cloud, contending
by the power of light with the demons of darkness,
rising in triumph to the zenith of heavenly
glory, then passing into the night of Nirvana and
disappearing from the scene.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>
<p>The difficulty about this solar myth theory is
that it proves too much; it is too powerful a solvent;
it would dissolve all history. How easy it
would be, in a few centuries, to turn General
Washington and the American Revolution into
a solar myth! Great Britain, a region of clouds
and rain, represents the Kingdom of Darkness;
America, with more sunshine, is the Day. Great
Britain, as Darkness, wishes to devour the Young
Day, or dawn of light, which America is about to
diffuse over the earth. But Washington, the solar
hero, arrives. He is from Virginia, that is, born of
a virgin. He was born in February, in the sign
of Aquarius and the Fishes,&mdash;plainly referring to
the birth of the sun from the ocean. As the sun
surveys the earth, so Washington was said to be
a surveyor of many regions. The story of the
fruitless attempts of the Indians to shoot him at
Braddock's defeat is evidently legendary; and,
in fact, this battle itself must be a myth, for how
can we suppose two English and French armies
to have crossed the Atlantic, and then gone into
a wilderness west of the mountains, to fight a
battle? So easy is it to turn history into a solar
myth.</p>

<p>The character of Sakya-muni must be learned
from his religion and from authentic tradition.
In many respects his character and influence
resembled that of Jesus. He opposed priestly
assumptions, taught the equality and brotherhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
of man, sent out disciples to teach his doctrine,
was a reformer who relied on the power of truth
and love. Many of his reported sayings resemble
those of Jesus. He was opposed by the Brahmans
as Jesus by the Pharisees. He compared the
Brahmans who followed their traditions to a chain
of blind men, who move on, not seeing where they
<span class="locked">go.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span> Like Jesus, he taught that mercy was better
than sacrifices. Like Jesus, he taught orally, and
left no writing. Jesus did not teach in Hebrew,
but in the Aramaic, which was the popular dialect,
and so the Buddha did not speak to the people in
Sanskrit, but in their own tongue, which was Pâli.
Like Jesus, he seems to have instructed his hearers
by parables or stories. He was one of the
greatest reformers the world has ever seen; and
his influence, after that of the Christ, has probably
exceeded that of any one who ever lived.</p>

<p>But, beside such real resemblances between
these two masters, we are told of others still more
striking, which would certainly be hard to explain
unless one of the systems had borrowed from the
other. These are said to be the preëxistence of
Buddha in heaven; his birth of a virgin; salutation
by angels; presentation in the temple; baptism
by fire and water; dispute with the doctors;
temptation in the wilderness; transfiguration;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
descent into hell; ascension into <span class="locked">heaven.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span> If
these legends could be traced back to the time
before Christ, then it might be argued that the
Gospels have borrowed from Buddhism. Such,
however, is not the fact. These stories are taken
from the Lalita Vistara, which, according to Rhys
<span class="locked">Davids,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> was probably composed between six hundred
and a thousand years after the time of Buddha,
by some Buddhist poet in Nepaul. Rhys
Davids, one of our best authorities, says of this
poem: "As evidence of what early Buddhism actually
was, it is of about the same value as some
mediæval poem would be of the real facts of the
gospel history."<a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> M. Ernest de Bunsen, in his
work on the "Angel Messiah," has given a very
exhaustive statement, says Mr. Davids, of all the
possible channels through which Christians can be
supposed to have borrowed from the Buddhists.
But Mr. Davids's conclusion is that he finds no
evidence of any such communications of ideas from
the East to the <span class="locked">West.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> The difference between
the wild stories of the Lalita Vistara and the
sober narratives of the Gospels is quite apparent.
Another writer, Professor <span class="locked">Seydel,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> thinks, after a
full and careful examination, that only five facts in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
the Gospels may have been borrowed from Buddhism.
These are: (1) The fast of Jesus before
his work; (2) The question in regard to the blind
man&mdash;"Who did sin, this man, or his parents"?
(3) The preëxistence of Christ; (4) The presentation
in the Temple; (5) Nathanael sitting under
a fig-tree, compared with Buddha under a Bo-tree.
But Kuenen has examined these parallels, and considers
them merely accidental coincidences. And,
in truth, it is very hard to conceive of one religion
borrowing its facts or legends from another, if
that other stands in no historic relation to it.
That Buddhism should have taken much from
Brahmanism is natural; for Brahmanism was its
mother. That Christianity should have borrowed
many of its methods from Judaism is equally natural;
for Judaism was its cradle. Modern travelers
in Burma and Tartary have found that the Buddhists
hold a kind of camp-meeting in the open
air, where they pray and sing. Suppose that some
critic, noticing this, should assert that, when Wesley
and his followers established similar customs,
they must have borrowed them from the Buddhists.
The absurdity would be evident. New religions
grow, they are not imitations.</p>

<p>It has been thought, however, that Christianity
was derived from the Essenes, because of certain
resemblances, and it is argued that the Essenes
must have obtained their monastic habits from the
Therapeutæ in Egypt, and that the Therapeutæ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
received them from the Buddhists, because they
could not have found them elsewhere. This theory,
however, has been dismissed from the scene
by the young German <span class="locked">scholar,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span> who has proved
that the essay on the Therapeutæ ascribed to Philo
was really written by a Christian anchorite in the
third or fourth century.</p>

<p>The result, then, of our investigation, is this:
There is no probability that the analogies between
Christianity and Buddhism have been derived the
one from the other. They have come from the
common and universal needs and nature of man,
which repeat themselves again and again in like
positions and like circumstances. That Jesus and
Buddha should both have retired into the wilderness
before undertaking their great work is probable,
for it has been the habit of other reformers
to let a period of meditation precede their coming
before the world. That both should have been
tempted to renounce their enterprise is also in
accordance with human nature. That, in after
times, the simple narratives should be overlaid
with additions, and a whole mass of supernatural
wonders added,&mdash;as we find in the Apocryphal
Gospels and the Lalita Vistara,&mdash;is also in accordance
with the working of the human mind.</p>

<p>Laying aside all such unsatisfactory resemblances,
we must regard the Buddha as having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
been one of the noblest of men, and one whom
Jesus would have readily welcomed as a fellow
worker and a friend. He opposed a dominant
priesthood, maintained the equal religious rights of
all mankind, overthrew caste, encouraged woman
to take her place as man's equal, forbade all bloody
sacrifices, and preached a religion of peace and
good will, seeking to triumph only in the fair conflict
of reason with reason. If he was defective
in the loftiest instincts of the soul; if he knew nothing
of the infinite and eternal; if he saw nothing
permanent in the soul of man; if his highest purpose
was negative,&mdash;to escape from pain, sorrow,
anxiety, toil,&mdash;let us still be grateful for the influence
which has done so much to tame the savage
Mongols, and to introduce hospitality and humanity
into the homes of Lassa and Siam. If Edwin
Arnold, a poet, idealizes him too highly, it is the
better fault, and should be easily forgiven. Hero-worshipers
are becoming scarce in our time; let us
make the most of those we have.</p>

<h2 title="WHY I AM NOT A FREE-RELIGIONIST"><a id="WHY">WHY I AM NOT A FREE-RELIGIONIST</a><a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></h2>

<p>What is meant by "Free Religion"? I understand
by it, individualism in religion. It is the
religious belief which has made itself independent
of historic and traditional influences, so far
as it is in the power of any one to attain such
independence. In Christian lands it means a religion
which has cut loose from the Bible and the
Christian Church, and which is as ready to question
the teaching of Jesus as that of Socrates or
Buddha. It is, what Emerson called himself, an
endless seeker, with no past behind it. It is entire
trust in the private reason as the sole authority in
matters of religion.</p>

<p>Free Religion may be regarded as Protestantism
carried to its ultimate results. A Protestant
<em>Christian</em> accepts the leadership of Jesus, and
keeps himself in the Christian communion; but he
uses his own private judgment to discover what
Jesus taught, and what Christianity really is. The
Free Religionist goes a step farther, and decides
by his own private judgment what is true and
what false, no matter whether taught by Jesus or
not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
Free Religion, as thus understood, seems to me
opposed to the law of evolution, and incompatible
with it. Evolution educes the present from the
past by a continuous process. Free Religion cuts
itself loose from the past, and makes every man
the founder of his own religion. According to
the law of evolution, confirmed by history, every
advance in religion is the development from something
going before. Jewish monotheism grew out
of polytheism; Christianity and Mohammedanism
out of Judaism; Buddhism out of Brahmanism;
Protestant Christianity out of the Roman Catholic
Church. Jesus himself said, "Think not that I
am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets:
I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil." The
higher religions are not made; they grow. Of
each it may be said, as of the poet: "Nascitur,
non fit." Therefore, if there is to arrive something
higher than our existing Christianity, it
must not be a system which forsakes the Christian
belief, but something developed from it.</p>

<p>According to the principle of evolution, every
growing and productive religion obeys the laws of
heredity and of variation. It has an inherited
common life, and a tendency to modification by
individual activity. Omit or depress either factor,
and the religion loses its power of growth. Without
a common life, the principle of development is
arrested. He who leaves the great current which
comes from the past loses headway. This current,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
in the Christian communion, is the inherited
spirit of Jesus. It is his life, continued in his
Church; his central convictions of love to God
and to man; of fatherhood and brotherhood; of
the power of truth to conquer error, of good
to overcome evil; of a Kingdom of Heaven to
come to us here. It is the faith of Jesus in things
unseen; his hope of the triumph of right over
wrong; his love going down to the lowliest child
of God. These vital convictions in the soul of
Jesus are communicated by contact from generation
to generation. They are propagated, as he
suggested, like leaven hidden in the dough. By
a different figure, Plato, in his dialogue of Ion,
shows that inspiration is transmitted like the magnetic
influence, which causes iron rings to adhere
and hang together in a chain. Thoughts and
opinions are communicated by argument, reasoning,
speech, and writing; but faith and inspiration
by the influence of life on life. The life of Jesus
is thus continued in his Church, and those who
stand outside of it lose much of this transmitted
and sympathetic influence. Common life in a
religious body furnishes the motive force which
carries it forward, while individual freedom gives
the power of improvement. The two principles
of heredity and variation must be united in order
to combine union and freedom, and to secure progress.
Where freedom of thought ceases, religion
becomes rigid. It is incapable of development.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Such, for instance, is the condition of Buddhism,
which, at first full of intellectual activity, has now
hardened into a monkish ritual.</p>

<p>Free Religion sacrifices the motive power derived
from association and religious sympathy for
the sake of a larger intellectual freedom. The
result is individualism. It founds no churches,
but spends much force in criticising the Christian
community, its belief, and its methods. These
are, no doubt, open to criticism, which would do
good if administered sympathetically and from
within, but produce little result when delivered
in the spirit of antagonism. Imperfect as the
Christian Church is, it ought to be remembered
that in it are to be found the chief strength and
help of the charities, philanthropies, and moral
reforms of our time. Every one who has at heart
a movement for the benefit of humanity appeals
instinctively for aid to the Christian churches. It
is in these that such movements usually originate,
and are carried on. Even when, as in the antislavery
movement, a part of the churches refuse
to sympathize with a new moral or social movement,
the reproaches made against them show that
in the mind of the community an interest in all
humane endeavor is considered to be a part of
their work. The common life and convictions
of these bodies enable them to accomplish what
individualism does not venture to undertake. Individualism
is incapable of organized and sustained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
work of this sort, though it can, and often does,
coöperate earnestly with it.</p>

<p>The teaching of Jesus is founded on the synthesis
of Truth and Love. Jesus declares himself
to have been born "to bear witness to the truth,"
and he also makes love, divine and human, the
substance of his gospel. The love element produces
union, the truth element, freedom. Union
without freedom stiffens into a rigid conservatism.
Freedom without union breaks up into an intellectual
atomism. The Christian churches have
gone into both extremes, but never permanently;
for Christianity, as long as it adheres to its founder
and his ideas, has the power of self-recovery. Its
diseases are self-limited.</p>

<p>It has had many such periods, but has recovered
from them. It passed through an age in which
it ran to ascetic self-denial, and made saints of
self-torturing anchorites. It afterward became a
speculative system, and tended to metaphysical
creeds and doctrinal distinctions. It became a
persecuting church, burning heretics and Jews,
and torturing infidels as an act of faith. It was
tormented by dark superstitions, believing in witchcraft
and magic. But it has left all these evils
behind. No one is now put to death for heresy or
witchcraft. The monastic orders in the Church
are preachers and teachers, or given to charity.
No one could be burned to-day as a heretic. No
one to-day believes in witchcraft. The old creeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
which once held the Church in irons are now slowly
disintegrating. But reform, as I have said, must
come from within, by the gradual elimination of
those inherited beliefs which interfere with the
unity of the Church and the leadership of Christ
himself. The Platonic and Egyptian Trinity remaining
as dogma, repeated but not understood,&mdash;the
Manichæan division of the human race into
children of God and children of the Devil,&mdash;the
scholastic doctrine of the Atonement, by which
the blood of Jesus expiates human guilt,&mdash;are
being gradually explained in accordance with reason
and the teaching of Jesus.</p>

<p>Some beliefs, once thought to be of vital importance,
are now seen by many to be unessential, or
are looked at in a different light. Instead of making
Jesus an exceptional person, we are coming to
regard him as a representative man, the realized
ideal of what man was meant to be, and will one
day become. Instead of considering his sinlessness
as setting him apart from his race, we look
on it as showing that sin is not the natural, but
unnatural, condition of mankind. His miracles
are regarded not as violations of the laws of
nature, but anticipations of laws which one day
will be universally known, and which are boundless
as the universe. Nor will they in future be
regarded as evidence of the mission of Jesus, since
he himself was grieved when they were so looked
upon, and he made his truth and his character the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
true evidence that he came from God. The old
distinction between "natural" and "supernatural"
will disappear when it is seen that Jesus had a
supernatural work and character, the same in kind
as ours, though higher in degree. The supreme
gifts which make him the providential leader of
the race do not set him apart from his brethren
if we see that it is a law of humanity that gifts
differ, and that men endowed with superior powers
become leaders in science, art, literature, politics;
as Jesus has become the chief great spiritual leader
of mankind.</p>

<p>Men are now searching the Scriptures, not under
the bondage of an infallible letter, but seeking
for the central ideas of Jesus and the spirit of
his gospel. They begin to accept the maxim of
Goethe: "No matter how much the gospels contradict
each other, provided the Gospel does not
contradict itself." The profound convictions of
Christ, which pervade all his teaching, give the
clue by which to explain the divergences in the
narrative. We interpret the letter by the light
of the spirit. We see how Jesus emphasized the
law of human happiness,&mdash;that it comes from
within, not from without; that the pure in heart
see God, and that it is more blessed to give than
to receive. We comprehend the stress he lays on
the laws of progress,&mdash;that he who humbleth himself
shall be exalted. We recognize his profound
conviction that all God's children are dear to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
that his sun shines on the evil and the good, and
that he will seek the one lost sheep till he find it.
We see his trust in the coming of the Kingdom
of God in this world, the triumph of good over
evil, and the approaching time when the knowledge
of God shall fill the earth as the waters
cover the sea. And we find his profound faith
in the immortal life which abides in us, so that
whoever shares that faith with him can never die.</p>

<p>The more firmly these central ideas of Jesus are
understood and held, the less importance belongs
to any criticism of the letter. This or that saying,
attributed to Jesus in the record, maybe subjected
to attack; but it is the main current of his teaching
which has made him the leader of civilized
man for eighteen centuries. That majestic stream
will sweep on undisturbed, though there may be
eddies here or stagnant pools there, which induce
hasty observers to suppose that it has ceased to
flow.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem" xml:lang="la" lang="la">
<span class="i0q">"Rusticus expectat dum defluit amnis, at ille<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Volvitur et volvetur, in omne volubilis ævium."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I sometimes read attacks on special sayings of
the record, which argue, to the critic's mind, that
Jesus was in error here, or mistaken there. But
I would recommend to such writers to ponder the
suggestive rule of Coleridge: "Until I can understand
the ignorance of Plato, I shall consider
myself ignorant of his understanding;" or the
remark of Emerson to the youth who brought him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
a paper in which he thought he had refuted Plato:
"If you attack the king, be sure that you kill
him."</p>

<p>When the Christian world really takes Jesus
<em>himself</em> as its leader, instead of building its faith
on opinions <em>about</em> him, we may anticipate the
arrival of that union which he foresaw and foretold&mdash;"As
thou, father, art in me, and I in thee,
that they also may be one in us, that the world may
believe that thou hast sent me." Then Christians,
ceasing from party strife and sectarian dissension,
will unite in one mighty effort to cure the evils of
humanity and redress its wrongs. Before a united
Christendom, what miseries could remain unrelieved?
War, that criminal absurdity, that monstrous
anachronism, must at last be abolished.
Pauperism, vice, and crime, though continuing in
sporadic forms, would cease to exist as a part of
the permanent institutions of civilization. A truly
Catholic Church, united under the Master, would
lead all humanity up to a higher plane. The immense
forces developed by modern science, and the
magnificent discoveries in the realm of nature, helpless
now to cure the wrongs of suffering man, would
become instruments of potent use under the guidance
of moral forces.</p>

<p>According to the law of evolution, this is what
we have a right to expect. If we follow the lines
of historic development, not being led into extreme
individualism; if we maintain the continuity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
of human progress, this vast result must finally
arrive. For such reasons I prefer to remain in
the communion of the Christian body, doing what
I may to assist its upward movement. For such
reasons I am not a Free Religionist.</p>

<h2 title="HAVE ANIMALS SOULS"><a id="HAVE">HAVE ANIMALS SOULS</a><a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></h2>

<p>To answer this question, we must first inquire
what we mean by a soul. If we mean a human
soul, it is certain that animals do not possess it,&mdash;at
least not in a fully developed condition. If we
mean, "Do they possess an immortal soul?" that
is, perhaps, a question difficult to answer either in
the affirmative or the negative. But if we mean
by the soul an immaterial principle of life, which
coördinates the bodily organization to a unity;
which is the ground of growth, activity, perception,
volition; which is intelligent, affectionate,
and to a certain extent free; then we must admit
that animals have souls.</p>

<p>The same arguments which induce us to believe
that there is a soul in man apply to animals. The
world has generally believed that in man, beside
the body, there is also soul. Why have people
believed it? The reason probably is, that, beside
all that can be accounted for as the result of the
juxtaposition of material particles, there remains
a very important element unaccounted for. Mechanical
and physical agency may explain much,
but the most essential characteristic of vital phenomena<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
they do not explain. They do not account
for the unity in variety, permanence in change,
growth from within by continuous processes, coming
from the vital functions in an organized body.
Every such body has a unity peculiar to itself,
which cannot be considered the result of the collocation
of material molecules. It is a unity which
controls these molecules, arranges and rearranges
them, maintains a steady activity, carries the body
through the phenomena of growth, and causes the
various organs to coöperate for the purposes of
the whole. The vital power is not merely the
result of material phenomena, but it reacts on these
as a cause. Add to this that strange phenomenon
of human consciousness, the sense of personality,&mdash;which
is the clear perception of selfhood as a
distinct unchanging unit, residing in a body all of
whose parts are in perpetual flux,&mdash;and we see
why the opinion of a soul has arisen. It has been
assumed by the common sense of mankind that in
every living body the cause of the mode of existence
of each part is contained in the whole. As
soon as death intervenes each part is left free
to pass through changes peculiar to itself alone.
Life is a power which acts from the whole upon
the parts, causing them to resist chemical laws,
which begin to act as soon as life departs. The
unity of a living body does not result from an ingenious
juxtaposition of parts, like that of a watch,
for example. For the unity of a living body implies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
that which is called "the vital vortex," or
perpetual exchange of particles.</p>

<p>A watch or clock is the nearest approach which
has been made by man to the creation of a living
being. A watch, for instance, contains the principle
of its action in itself, and is not moved from
without; in that it resembles a living creature.
We can easily conceive of a watch which might be
made to go seventy years, without being wound up.
It might need to be oiled occasionally, but not as
often as an animal needs to be fed. A watch is
also like a living creature in having a unity as a
whole not belonging to the separate parts, and to
which all parts conspire,&mdash;namely, that of marking
the progress of time. Why, then, say that a man
has a soul, and that a watch has not? The difference
is this. The higher principle of unity in
the watch, that is, its power of marking time, is
wholly an effect, and never a cause. It is purely
and only the result of the arrangement of wheels
and springs; in other words, of material conditions.
But in man, the principle of unity is also a cause.
Life reacts upon body. The laws of matter are
modified by the power of life, chemical action is
suspended, living muscles are able to endure without
laceration the application of forces which
would destroy the dead fibre. So the thought, the
love, the will of a living creature react on the physical
frame. A sight, a sound, a few spoken words,
a message seen in a letter, cause an immense revulsion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
in the physical condition. Something is suddenly
told us, and we faint away, or even die, from
the effect of the message. Here mind acts upon
matter, showing that in man mind is not merely a
result, but also a cause. Hence men have generally
believed in the existence of a soul in man.
They have not been taught it by metaphysicians, it
is one of the spontaneous inductions of common
sense from universal experience.</p>

<p>But this argument applies equally to prove a
soul in animals. The same reaction of soul on
body is constantly apparent. Every time that you
whistle to your dog, and he comes bounding toward
you, his mind has acted on his body. His will has
obeyed his thought, his muscles have obeyed his
will. The cause of his motion was mental, not
physical. This is too evident to require any further
illustration. Therefore, regarding the soul
as a principle of life, connected with the body but
not its result, or, in other words, as an immaterial
principle of activity, there is the same reason for
believing in the soul of animals that there is for
believing in the soul of man.</p>

<p>But when we ask as to the nature of the animal
soul, and how far it is analogous to that of man,
we meet with certain difficulties. Let us see then
how many of the human qualities of the soul are to
be found in animals, and so discover if there is any
remainder not possessed by them, peculiar to ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
That the vital soul, or principle of life, belongs
equally to plants, animals, and men, is evident.
This is so apparent as to be granted even by Descartes,
who regards animals as mere machines, or
automata, destitute of a thinking soul, but not of
life or feeling. They are automata, but living and
feeling automata. Descartes denies them a soul,
because he defines the soul as the thinking and
knowing power. But Locke (with whom Leibnitz
fully agreed on this point) ascribes to animals
thought as well as feeling, and makes their difference
from man to consist in their not possessing
abstract ideas. We shall presently see the truth
of this most sagacious remark.</p>

<p>Plants, animals, and men are alike in possessing
the vital principle, which produces growth, which
causes them to pass through regular phases of development,
which enables them to digest and assimilate
food taken from without, and which carries on
a steady circulation within. To this are added, in
the animal, the function of voluntary locomotion,
perception through the senses of an outward world,
the power of feeling pleasure and pain, some
wonderful instincts, and some degree of reflective
thought. Animals also possess memory, imagination,
playfulness, industry, the sense of shame, and
many other very human qualities.</p>

<p>Take, for example, Buffon's fine description of
the dog ("Histoire du Chien"):&mdash;</p>

<p>"By nature fiery, irritable, ferocious, and sanguinary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
the dog in his savage state is a terror to
other animals. But domesticated he becomes
gentle, attached, and desirous to please. He hastens
to lay at the feet of his master his courage,
his strength, and all his abilities. He listens for
his master's orders, inquires his will, consults his
opinion, begs his permission, understands the indications
of his wishes. Without possessing the
power of human thought, he has all the warmth of
human sentiment. He has more than human fidelity,
he is constant in his attachments. He is made
up of zeal, ardor, and obedience. He remembers
kindness longer than wrong. He endures bad
treatment and forgets it&mdash;disarming it by patience
and submission."</p>

<p>No one who has ever had a dog for a friend will
think this description exaggerated. If any should
so consider it, we will cite for their benefit what
Mr. Jesse, one of the latest students of the canine
race, asserts concerning it, in his "Researches into
the History of the British Dog" (London, 1866).
He says that remarkable instances of the following
virtues, feelings, and powers of mind are well <span class="locked">authenticated:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"The dog risks his life to give help; goes for
assistance; saves life from drowning, fire, other
animals, and men; assists distress; guards property;
knows boundaries; resents injuries; repays
benefits; communicates ideas; combines with other
dogs for several purposes; understands language;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
knows when he is about to die; knows death in a
human being; devotes his whole life to the object
of his love; dies of grief and of joy; dies in his
master's defense; commits suicide; remains by the
dead; solicits, and gives alarm; knows the characters
of men; recognizes a portrait, and men after
long absence; is fond of praise and sensible to ridicule;
feels shame, and is sensible of a fault; is
playful; is incorruptible; finds his way back from
distant countries; is magnanimous to smaller animals;
is jealous; has dreams; and takes a last
farewell when dying."</p>

<p>Much of this, it may be said, is instinctive. We
must therefore distinguish between Instinct and
Intelligence; or, rather, between instinctive intelligence
and reflective intelligence. Many writers
on the subject of animals have not carefully distinguished
these very different activities of the soul.
Even M. Leroy, one of the first in modern times
who brought careful observation to the study of
the nature of animals, has not always kept in view
this distinction&mdash;as has been noticed by a subsequent
French writer of very considerable ability,
M. <span class="locked">Flourens.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span> The following marks, according
to M. Flourens, distinguish instinct from <span class="locked">intelligence:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Thus the building faculty of the beaver is an instinct,
for it acts spontaneously, and always in the
same way. It is not a general faculty of building
in all places and ways, but a special power of
building houses of sticks, mud, and other materials,
with the entrance under water and a dry place
within. When beavers build on a running stream,
they begin by making a dam across it, which preserves
them from losing the water in a drought;
but this also is a spontaneous and invariable act.
The old stories of their driving piles, using their
tails for trowels, and having well-planned houses
with many chambers, have been found to be fictitious.
That the beaver builds by instinct, though
intelligence comes in to modify the instinct, appears
from his wishing to build his house or his dam
when it is not needed. Mr. Broderip, the English
naturalist, had a pet beaver that manifested his
building instinct by dragging together warming-pans,
sweeping-brushes, boots, and sticks, which he
would lay crosswise. He then would fill in his
wall with clothes, bits of coal, turf, laying it very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
even. Finally, he made a nest for himself behind
his wall with clothes, hay, and cotton. As this
creature had been brought from America very
young, all this procedure must have been instinctive.
But his intelligence showed itself in his
adapting his mode of building to his new circumstances.
His instinct led him to build his wall,
and to lay his sticks crosswise, and to fill in with
what he could find, according to the universal and
spontaneous procedure of all beavers. But his
making use of a chest of drawers for one side of
his wall, and taking brushes and boots instead of
cutting down trees, were no doubt acts of intelligence.</p>

<p>A large part of the wonderful procedure of bees
is purely instinctive. Bees, from the beginning
of the world, and in all countries of the earth,
have lived in similar communities; have had their
queen, to lay eggs for them: if their queen is lost,
have developed a new one in the same way, by
altering the conditions of existence in one of their
larvæ; have constructed their hexagonal cells by
the same mathematical law, so as to secure the
most strength with the least outlay of material.
All this is instinct&mdash;for it is spontaneous and not
deliberate; it is universal and constant. But when
the bee deflects his comb in order to avoid a stick
thrust across the inside of the hive, and begins the
variation before he reaches the stick, this can only
be regarded as an act of intelligence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Animals, then, have both instincts and intelligence;
and so has man. A large part of human
life proceeds from tendencies as purely, if not as
vigorously, instinctive as those of animals. Man
has social instincts, which create human society.
Children play from an instinct. The maternal
instinct in a human mother is, till modified by
reflection, as spontaneous, universal, and necessary
as the same instinct in animals. But in man the
instincts are reduced to a minimum, and are soon
modified by observation, experience, and reflection.
In animals they are at their maximum, and are
modified in a much less degree.</p>

<p>It is sometimes said that animals do not reason,
but man does. But animals are quite capable of
at least two modes of reasoning, that of comparison
and that of inference. They compare two
modes of action, or two substances, and judge the
one to be preferable to the other, and accordingly
select it. Sir Emerson Tennent tells us that elephants,
employed to build stone walls in Ceylon,
will lay each stone in its place, then stand off and
look to see if it is plumb, and, if not, will move
it with their trunk, till it lies perfectly straight.
This is a pure act of reflective judgment. He
narrates an adventure which befell himself in Ceylon
while riding on a narrow road through the
forest. He heard a rumbling sound approaching,
and directly there came to meet him an elephant,
bearing on his tusks a large log of wood, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
had been directed to carry to the place where it
was needed. Sir Emerson Tennent's horse, unused
to these monsters, was alarmed, and refused to go
forward. The sagacious elephant, perceiving this,
evidently decided that he must himself go out of
the way. But to do this, he was obliged first
to take the log from his tusks with his trunk,
and lay it on the ground, which he did, and then
backed out of the road between the trees till only
his head was visible. But the horse was still too
timid to go by, whereupon the judicious pachyderm
pushed himself farther back, till all of his body,
except the end of his trunk, had disappeared.
Then Sir Emerson succeeded in getting his horse
by, but stopped to witness the result. The elephant
came out, took the log up again, laid it
across his tusks, and went on his way. This story,
told by an unimpeachable witness, shows several
successive acts of reasoning. The log-bearer inferred
from the horse's terror that it would not
pass; he again inferred that in that case he must
himself get out of the way; that, to do this, he
must lay down his log; that he must go farther
back; and accompanying this was his sense of
duty, making him faithful to his task; and, most
of all, his consideration of what was due to this
human traveler, which kept him from driving the
horse and man before him as he went on.</p>

<p>There is another well-authenticated anecdote of
an elephant; he was following an ammunition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
wagon, and saw the man who was seated on it fall
off just before the wheel. The man would have
been crushed had not the animal instantly run
forward, and, without an order, lifted the wheel
with his trunk, and held it suspended in the air,
till the wagon had passed over the man without
hurting him. Here were combined presence of
mind, good will, knowledge of the danger to the
man, and a rapid calculation of how he could be
saved.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may properly introduce here an account
of the manifestations of mind in the animals
I have had the most opportunity of observing. I
have a horse, who was named Rubezahl, after
the mountain spirit of the Harz made famous in
the stories of Musaeus. We have contracted his
name to Ruby for convenience. Now I have reason
to believe that Ruby can distinguish Sunday
from other days. On Sunday I have been in the
habit of driving to Boston to church; but on
other days, I drive to the neighboring village,
where are the post-office, shops of mechanics, and
other stores. To go to Boston, I usually turn to
the right when I leave my driveway; to go to the
village, I turn to the left. Now, on Sunday, if I
leave the reins loose, so that the horse may do as
he pleases, he invariably turns to the right, and
goes to Boston. On other days, he as invariably
turns to the left, and goes to the village. He does
this so constantly and regularly, that none of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
family have any doubt of the fact that he knows
that it is Sunday; <em>how</em> he knows it we are unable
to discover. I have left my house at the same
hour on Sunday and on Monday, in the same
carriage, with the same number of persons in it;
and yet on Sunday he always turns to the right,
and on Monday to the left. He is fed at the same
time on Sunday as on other days, but the man
comes back to harness him a little later on Sunday
than at other times, and that is possibly his method
of knowing that it is the day for going to Boston.
But see how much of observation, memory, and
thought is implied in all this.</p>

<p>Again, Ruby has shown a very distinct feeling
of the supernatural. Driving one day up a hill
near my house, we met a horse-car coming down
toward us, running without horses, simply by the
force of gravity. My horse became so frightened
that he ran into the gutter, and nearly overturned
me; and I got him past with the greatest difficulty.
Now he had met the cars coming down that hill,
drawn by horses, a hundred times, and had never
been alarmed. Moreover, only a day or two after,
in going up the same hill, we saw a car moving
uphill, before us, where the horses were entirely
invisible, being concealed by the car itself, which
was between us and the horses. But this did not
frighten Ruby at all. He evidently said to himself,
"The horses are there, though I do not
see them." But in the other case it seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
him an effect without a cause&mdash;something plainly
supernatural. There was nothing in the aspect
of the car itself to alarm him; he had seen that
often enough. He was simply terrified by seeing
it move without any adequate cause&mdash;just as we
should be, if we saw our chairs begin to walk
about the room.</p>

<p>Our Newfoundland dog's name is Donatello;
which, again, is shortened to Don in common parlance.
He has all the affectionate and excellent
qualities of his race. He is the most good-natured
creature I ever saw. Nothing provokes him. Little
dogs may yelp at him, the cat or kittens may snarl
and spit at him: he pays no attention to them.
A little dog climbs on his back, and lies down
there; one of the cats will lie between his legs.
But at night, when he is on guard, no one can approach
the house unchallenged.</p>

<p>But his affection for the family is very great.
To be allowed to come into the house and lie down
near us is his chief happiness. He was very fond
of my son E&mdash;&mdash;, who played with him a good
deal, and when the young man went away, during
the war, with a three months' regiment, Don was
much depressed by his absence. He walked down
regularly to the station, and stood there till a train
of cars came in; and when his friend did not arrive
in it, he went back, with a melancholy air, to the
house. But at last the young man returned. It
was in the evening, and Don was lying on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
piazza. As soon as he saw his friend, his exultation
knew no bounds. He leaped upon him, and
ran round him, barking and showing the wildest
signs of delight. All at once he turned and ran
up into the garden, and came back bringing an
apple, which he laid down at the feet of his young
master. It was the only thing he could think of
to do for him&mdash;and this sign of his affection was
quite pathetic.</p>

<p>The reason why Don thought of the apple was
probably this: we had taught him to go and get
an apple for the horse, when so directed. We
would say, "Go, Don, get an apple for poor
Ruby;" then he would run up into the garden,
and bring an apple, and hold it up to the horse;
and perhaps when the horse tried to take it he
would pull it away. After doing this a few times,
he would finally lie down on his back under the
horse's nose, and allow the latter to take the apple
from his mouth. He would also kiss the horse, on
being told to do so. When we said, "Don, kiss
poor Ruby," he leaped up and kissed the horse's
nose. But he afterwards hit upon a more convenient
method of doing it. He got his paw over the
rein and pulled down the horse's head, so that he
could continue the osculatory process more at his
ease, sitting comfortably on the ground.</p>

<p>Animals know when they have done wrong; so
far, at least, as that means disobeying our will
or command. The only great fault which Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
ever committed was stealing a piece of meat from
our neighbor's kitchen. I do not think he was
punished or even scolded for it; for we did not
find it out till later, when it would have done no
good to punish him. But a week or two after
that, the gentleman whose kitchen had been robbed
was standing on my lawn, talking with me, and he
referred, laughingly, to what Don had done. He
did not even look at the dog, much less change his
tones to those of rebuke. But the moment Don
heard his name mentioned, he turned and walked
away, and hid himself under the low branches of
a Norway spruce near by. He was evidently profoundly
ashamed of himself. Was this the result
of conscience, or of the love of approbation? In
either case, it was very human.</p>

<p>That the love of approbation is common to many
animals we all know. Dogs and horses certainly
can be influenced by praise and blame, as easily as
men. Many years ago we had occasion to draw
a load of gravel, and we put Ruby into a tip-cart
to do the work. He was profoundly depressed,
and evidently felt it as a degradation. He hung
his head, and showed such marks of humiliation
that we have never done it since. But on the
other hand, when he goes out, under the saddle,
by the side of a young horse, this veteran animal
tries as hard to appear young as any old bachelor
of sixty years who is still ambitious of social
triumphs. He dances along, and goes sideways,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
and has all the airs and graces of a young colt.
All this, too, is very human.</p>

<p>At one time my dog was fond of going to the
railway station to see the people, and I always
ordered him to go home, fearing he should be hurt
by the cars. He easily understood that if he went
there, it was contrary to my wishes. Nevertheless,
he often went; and I do not know but this fondness
for forbidden fruit was rather human, too.
So, whenever he was near the station, if he saw
me coming, he would look the other way, and pretend
not to know me. If he met me anywhere
else, he always bounded to meet me with great
delight. But at the station it was quite different.
He would pay no attention to my whistle or my
call. He even pretended to be another dog, and
would look me right in the face without apparently
recognizing me. He gave me the cut direct,
in the most impertinent manner; the reason evidently
being that he knew he was doing what was
wrong, and did not like to be found out. Possibly
he may have relied a little on my near-sightedness,
in this man&oelig;uvre.</p>

<p>That animals have acute observation, memory,
imagination, the sense of approbation, strong affections,
and the power of reasoning is therefore
very evident. Lord Bacon also speaks of a dog's
reverence for his master as partaking of a religious
element. "Mark," says he, "what a generosity
and courage a dog will put on, when he finds himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
maintained by a man, who to him is instead
of a God&mdash;which courage he could not attain,
without that confidence in a better nature than his
own." Who that has seen the mute admiration
and trust in a dog's eye, as he looks up at his
master, but can see in it something of a religious
reverence, the germ and first principle of religion?</p>

<p>What, then, is the difference between the human
soul and that of the animal in its highest development?</p>

<p>That there is a very marked difference between
man and the highest animal is evident. The human
being, weaker in proportion than all other
animals, has subjected them all to himself. He
has subdued the earth by his inventions. Physically
too feeble to dig a hole in the ground like
a rabbit, or to fell a tree like a beaver; unable to
live in the water like a fish, or to move through
the air like a bird; he yet, by his inventive power
and his machinery, can compel the forces of nature
to work for him. They are the true genii, slaves
of his lamp. Air, fire, water, electricity, and magnetism
build his cities and his stately ships, run
his errands, carry him from land to land, and accept
him as their master.</p>

<p>Whence does man obtain this power? Some
say it is <em>the human hand</em> which has made man
supreme. It is, no doubt, a wonderful machine;
a box of tools in itself. The size and strength of
the thumb, and the power of opposing it to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
extremities of the fingers, distinguishes, according
to most anatomists, the human hand from that of
the quadrumanous animals. In those monkeys
which are nearest to man, the thumb is so short
and weak, and the fingers so long and slender, that
their tips can scarcely be brought in opposition.
Excellent for climbing, they are not good for taking
up small objects or supporting large ones.
But the hand of man could accomplish little without
the mind behind it. It was therefore a good
remark of Galen, that "man is not the wisest of
animals because he has a hand; but God has given
him a hand because he is the wisest of animals."</p>

<p>The size of the human brain, relatively greater
than that of almost any other animal; man's structure,
adapting him to stand erect; his ability to
exist in all climates; his power of subsisting on
varied food: all these facts of his physical nature
are associated with his superior mental power, but
do not produce it. The question recurs, What
enables him to stand at the head of the animal
creation?</p>

<p>Perhaps the chief apparent distinctions between
man and other animals are <span class="locked">these:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. The lowest races of men use tools; other
animals do not.</p>

<p>2. The lowest human beings possess a verbal
language; other animals have none.</p>

<p>3. Man has the capacity of self-culture, as an
individual; other animals have not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
4. Human beings, associated in society, are
capable of progress in civilization, by means of
science, art, literature, and religion; other animals
are not.</p>

<p>5. Men have a capacity for religion; no animal,
except man, has this.</p>

<p>The lowest races of men use tools, but no other
animal does this. This is so universally admitted
by science that the presence of the rudest tools of
stone is considered a sufficient trace of the presence
of man. If stone hatchets or hammers or arrowheads
are found in any stratum, though no human
bones are detected, anthropologists regard this as a
sufficient proof of the existence of human beings in
the period indicated by such a geologic formation.
The only tools used by animals in procuring food,
in war, or in building their homes, are their natural
organs: their beaks, teeth, claws, etc. It may be
added that man alone wears clothes; other animals
being sufficiently clothed by nature. No animals
make a fire, though they often suffer from cold;
but there is no race of men unacquainted with the
use of <span class="locked">fire.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span></p>

<p>No animals possess a verbal language. Animals
can remember some of the words used by men, and
associate with them their meaning. But this is
not the use of language. It is merely the memory
of two associated facts,&mdash;as when the animal recollects
where he found food, and goes to the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
place to look for it again. Animals have different
cries, indicating different wants. They use one
cry to call their mate, another to terrify their prey.
But this is not the use of verbal language. Human
language implies not merely an acquaintance
with the meaning of particular words, but the
power of putting them together in a sentence.
Animals have no such language as this; for, if
they had, it would have been learned by men.
Man has the power of learning any verbal language.
Adelung and Vater reckon over three
thousand languages spoken by men, and any man
can learn any of them. The negroes speak their
own languages in their own countries; they speak
Arabic in North Africa; they learn to speak English,
French, and Spanish in America, and Oriental
languages when they go to the East. If any animals
had a verbal language, with its vocabulary
and grammar, men would long ago have learned
it, and would have been able to converse with
them.</p>

<p>Again, no animal except man is capable of self-culture,
as an individual. Animals are trained by
external influences; they do not teach themselves.
An old wolf is much more cunning than a young
one, but he has been made so by the force of circumstances.
You can teach your dog tricks, but
no dog has ever taught himself any. Yet the
lowest savages teach themselves to make tools,
to ornament their paddles and clubs, and acquire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
certain arts by diligent effort. Birds will sometimes
practice the tunes which they hear played,
till they have learned them. They will also sometimes
imitate each other's songs. That is, they
possess the power of vocal imitation. But to imitate
the sounds we hear is not self-culture. It is
not developing a new power, but it is exercising
in a new way a natural gift. Yet we must admit
that in this habit of birds there is the rudiment, at
least, of self-education.</p>

<p>All races of men are capable of progress in civilization.
Many, indeed, remain in a savage state
for thousands of years, and we cannot positively
prove that any particular race which has always
been uncivilized is capable of civilization. But we
are led to believe it from having known of so many
tribes of men who have emerged from apathy, ignorance,
and barbarism into the light of science and
art. So it was with all the Teutonic races,&mdash;the
Goths, Germans, Kelts, Lombards, Scandinavians.
So it was with the Arabs, who roamed for thousands
of years over the deserts, a race of ignorant
robbers, and then, filled with the great inspiration
of Islam, flamed up into a brilliant coruscation
of science, literature, art, military success, and
profound learning. What great civilizations have
grown up in China, India, Persia, Assyria, Babylon,
Ph&oelig;nicia, Egypt, Greece, Rome, Carthage,
Etruria! But no such progress has ever appeared
among the animals. As their parents were, five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
thousand years ago, so, essentially, are they
now.</p>

<p>Nor are animals religious, in the sense of worshiping
unseen powers higher than themselves.
My horse showed a sense of the supernatural, but
this is not worship.</p>

<p>These are some of the most marked points of
difference between man and all other animals.
Now these can all be accounted for by the hypothesis
in which Locke and Leibnitz both agreed;
namely, that while animals are capable of reasoning
about facts, they are incapable of abstract
ideas. Or, we may say with Coleridge, that while
animals, in common with man, possess the faculty
of understanding, they do not possess that of reason.
Coleridge seems to have intended by this exactly
what Locke and Leibnitz meant by their statement.
When my dog Don heard the word "apple," he
thought of the particular concrete apple under the
tree; and not of apples in general, and their relation
to pears, peaches, etc. Don understood me
when I told him to go and get an apple, and
obeyed; but he would not have understood me if
I had remarked to him that apples were better than
pears, more wholesome than peaches, not so handsome
as grapes. I should then have gone into the
region of abstract and general ideas.</p>

<p>Now it is precisely the possession of this power
of abstract thought which will explain the superiority
of man to all other animals. It explains the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
use of tools; for a tool is an instrument prepared,
not for one special purpose, but to be used generally,
in certain ways. A baboon, like a man, might
pick up a particular stone with which to crack a
particular nut; but the ape does not make and
keep a stone hammer, to be used on many similar
occasions. A box of tools contains a collection of
saws, planes, draw-knives, etc., not made to use on
one occasion merely, but made for sawing, cutting,
and planing purposes generally.</p>

<p>Still more evident is it that the power of abstraction
is necessary for verbal language. We do
not here use the common term "articulate speech,"
for we can conceive of animals articulating their
vocal sounds. But "a word" is an abstraction.
The notion is lifted out of the concrete particular
fact, and deposited in the abstract general term.
All words, except proper names, are abstract; and
to possess and use a verbal language is impossible,
without the possession of this mental faculty.</p>

<p>In regard to self-culture, it is clear that for any
steady progress one must keep before his mind an
abstract idea of what he wishes to do. This enables
him to rise above impulse, passion, instinct,
habit, circumstance. By the steady contemplation
of the proposed aim, one can arrange circumstances,
restrain impulse, direct one's activity, and
become really free.</p>

<p>In like manner, races become developed in civilization
by the impact of abstract ideas. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
it is by coming in contact with other civilized
nations, which gives them an ideal superior to anything
before known. Sometimes the motive power
of their progress is the reception of truths of science,
art, literature, or religion.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to show that without abstract,
universal, and necessary ideas no religion is possible;
for religion, being the worship of unseen
powers, conceived as existing, as active, as spiritual,
necessarily implies these ideas in the mind of
the worshiper.</p>

<p>We find, then, in the soul of animals all active,
affectionate, and intelligent capacities, as in that
of man. The only difference is that man is capable
of abstract ideas, which give him a larger liberty of
action, which enable him to adopt an aim and pursue
it, and which change his affections from an instinctive
attachment into a principle of generous
love. Add, then, to the animal soul the capacity
for abstract ideas, and it would rise at once to the
level of man. Meantime, in a large part of their
nature, they have the same faculties with ourselves.
They share our emotions, and we theirs. They
are made "a little lower" than man, and if we
are souls, so surely are they.</p>

<p>Are they immortal? To discuss this question
would require more space than we can here give to
it. For my own part, I fully believe in the continued
existence of all souls, at the same time assuming
their continued advance. The law of life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
is progress; and one of the best features in the
somewhat unspiritual theory of Darwin is its profound
faith in perpetual improvement. This theory
is the most startling optimism that has ever been
taught, for it makes perpetual progress to be the
law of the whole universe.</p>

<p>Many of the arguments for the immortality of
man cannot indeed be used for our dumb relations,
the animals. We cannot argue from their universal
faith in a future life; nor contend that they
need an immortality on moral grounds, to recompense
their good conduct and punish their wickedness.
We might indeed adduce a reason implied
in our Saviour's parable, and believe that the poor
creatures who have received their evil things in this
life will be comforted in another. Moreover, we
might find in many animals qualities fitting them
for a higher state. There are animals, as we have
seen, who show a fidelity, courage, generosity,
often superior to what we see in man. The dogs
who have loved their master more than food, and
starved to death on his grave, are surely well fitted
for a higher existence. Jesse tells a story of a cat
which was being stoned by cruel boys. Men went
by, and did not interfere; but a dog, that saw
it, did. He drove away the boys, and then took
the cat to his kennel, licked her all over with his
tongue, and his conduct interested people, who
brought her milk. The canine nurse took care of
her till she was well, and the cat and dog remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
fast friends ever after. Such an action in a man
would have been called heroic; and we think such
a dog would not be out of place in heaven.</p>

<p>Yet it is not so much on particular cases of animal
superiority that we rely, but on the difficulty
of conceiving, in any sense, of the destruction of
life. The principle of life, whether we call it soul
or body, matter or spirit, escapes all observation of
the senses. All that we know of it by observation
is that, beside the particles of matter which compose
an organized body, there is something else,
not cognizable by the senses, which attracts and
dismisses them, modifies and coördinates them.
The unity of the body is not to be found in its
sensible phenomena, but in something which escapes
the senses. Into the vortex of that life material
molecules are being continually absorbed, and from
it they are perpetually discharged. If death means
the dissolution of the body, we die many times in
the course of our earthly career, for every body is
said by human anatomists to be changed in all its
particles once in seven years. What then remains,
if all the particles go? The principle of organization
remains, and this invisible, persistent principle
constitutes the identity of every organized body. If
I say that I have the <em>same</em> body when I am fifty
which I had at twenty, it is because I mean by
"body" that which continues unaltered amid the
fast-flying particles of matter. This life principle
makes and remakes the material frame; that body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
does not make it. When what we call death intervenes,
all that we can assert is that the life principle
has done wholly and at once what it has
always been doing gradually and in part. What
happens to the material particles, we see: they become
detached from the organizing principle, and
relapse into simply mechanical and chemical conditions.
What has happened to that organizing
principle we neither see nor know; and we have
absolutely no reason at all for saying that it has
ceased to exist.</p>

<p>This is as true of plants and of animals as of
men; and there is no reason for supposing that
when these die their principle of life is ended. It
probably has reached a crisis, which consists in
the putting on of new forms and ascending into
a higher order of organized existence.</p>

<h2 title="APROPOS OF TYNDALL"><a id="APROPOS">APROPOS OF TYNDALL</a><a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></h2>

<p>We have all read in our "Vicar of Wakefield"
the famous speech made by the venerable and
learned Ephraim Jenkinson to good Dr. Primrose:
"The cosmogony, or creation of the world,
has puzzled philosophers in all ages. Sanchoniathon,
Manetho, Berosus, and Ocellus Lucanus
have all attempted it in vain," etc. But we hardly
expected to have this question of cosmogony reopened
by an eminent scientist in an address to
the British Association. What "Sanchoniathon,
Manetho, Berosus, and Ocellus Lucanus have all
attempted in vain" Professor Tyndall has not
only discussed before a body of men learned in
the physical sciences, but has done it in such a
manner as to rouse two continents to a new interest
in the question. One party has immediately
accused him of irreligion and infidelity, while another
has declared his statements innocent if not
virtuous. But the question which has been least
debated is, What has the professor really said?
or, Has he said anything?</p>

<p>The celebrated sentence which has occasioned
this excitement is as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
"Abandoning all disguise, the confession that I
feel bound to make before you is, that I prolong
the vision backward across the boundary of the
experimental evidence, and discern in that matter
which we in our ignorance, and notwithstanding
our professed reverence for its Creator, have
hitherto covered with opprobrium, the promise
and potency of every form and quality of life."</p>

<p>Does he, then, declare himself a materialist? A
materialist is one who asserts everything which
exists to be matter, or an affection of matter.
What, then, is matter, and how is that to be defined?
The common definition of matter is, that
which is perceived by the senses, or the substance
underlying sensible phenomena. By means of the
senses we perceive such qualities or phenomena as
resistance, form, color, perfume, sound. Whenever
we observe these phenomena, whenever we
see, hear, taste, touch, or smell, we attribute the
affections thus excited to an external substance,
which we call <em>matter</em>. But we are aware of other
phenomena which are <em>not</em> perceived by the senses,&mdash;such
as thought, love, and will. We are as
certain of their existence as we are of sensible
phenomena. I am as sure of the reality of love
as I am of the whiteness of chalk. By a law
of our mind, whenever we perceive sensible phenomena,
we necessarily attribute them to a substance
outside of ourselves, which we call matter.
And by another law, or the same law, whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
we perceive the phenomena of consciousness, we
necessarily attribute them to a substance which we
call soul, mind, or spirit. All that we know of
matter, and all that we know of soul, is their phenomena,
and as these are entirely different, we are
obliged to assume that matter and mind are different.
None of the qualities or attributes of
matter belong to mind, none of those of mind to
matter.</p>

<p>Does Tyndall deny this distinction? Apparently
not. He not only makes Bishop Butler declare,
with unanswerable power, that materialism
can never show any connection between molecular
processes and the phenomena of consciousness, but
he distinctly iterates this in his own person at the
end of the address; asserting that there is no
fusion possible between the two classes of facts,
those of sensation and those of consciousness.
Professor Tyndall, then, in the famous sentence
above quoted, does not declare himself a materialist
in the only sense in which the term has hitherto
been used. He does not pretend that sensation,
thought, emotion, and will are reducible, in the
last analysis, to solidity, extension, divisibility,
etc.; he positively and absolutely denies this.</p>

<p>When Tyndall, therefore, asserts that he discerns
in matter the promise and potency of every
form and quality of life, he uses the word "matter"
in a new sense. He does not mean by it the
underlying subject of sensible phenomena. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
not the matter which we see, hear, touch, taste,
and smell. What is it then? It is something
beyond the limits of observation and experiment;
for he says that in order to discover it we must
"prolong the vision backward across the boundary
of the experimental evidence." In short, it is
something which we know nothing about. It is a
conjecture, an opinion, a theoretical matter. In
another place he calls this imaginary substance "a
cosmical life." This something, which shall be
the common basis of the phenomena of sense and
soul, not only is not known, but apparently is not
knowable. For he assures us that the very attempt
to understand this cosmical life which makes
the connection between physical and mental phenomena,
is "to soar in a vacuum," or "to try to
lift one's self by his own waistband."</p>

<p>Of course, then, the contents of the famous
sentence are not <em>science</em>. It is not the great scientist,
the profound observer of nature, the distinguished
experimentalist, who speaks to us in that
sentence, but one who is theorizing, as we all have
a right to theorize. We also, if we choose, may
imagine some "cosmical life" behind both matter
and soul, as the common origin of both, and call
this life <em>spirit</em>. We shall then be thinking of
exactly the same substance that Tyndall is thinking
of, only we give it another name. He has
merely given another name to the great Being
behind all the phenomena of body and soul, out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
which or whom all proceed. But to give another
name to a fact is not to tell us anything more
about it. All meaning having evaporated from the
word "matter," the sentence loses its whole significance,
and it appears that the alarming declaration
asserts nothing at all! In "abandoning all
disguise" Tyndall has run little risk, for our
analysis shows that he has not asserted anything
except, perhaps, this, that there is, in his judgment,
some unknown common basis in which matter
and mind both inhere. This assertion is not
alarming nor dangerous, for it is only what has
always been believed.</p>

<p>As there is no materialism, in any known sense
of that term, in the doctrine of this address, so
likewise there is no atheism. In fact, in this same
sentence Tyndall speaks of the "creator" of what
he likes to call "matter" or "cosmical life." He
objects strongly to a creator who works mechanically,
and he seems to reprove Darwin for admitting
an original or primordial form, created
at first by the Deity. "The anthropomorphism,
which it seemed the object of Mr. Darwin to set
aside, is as firmly associated with the creation of a
few forms as with the creation of a multitude."
In another passage he says: "Is there not a temptation
to close to some extent with Lucretius,
when he affirms that nature is seen to do all
things spontaneously of herself without the meddling
of the gods?". But this last sentence shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
a singular vacillation in so clear a thinker as
Tyndall. How can one close "to some extent"
with such a statement as that of Lucretius? Either
the gods meddle, or they do not meddle. They
can hardly be considered as meddling "to some extent."
In still another passage he contrasts the
doctrine of evolution with the usual doctrine of
creation, rejecting the last in favor of the other,
because creation makes of God "an artificer, fashioned
after the human model, and acting by broken
efforts, as man is seen to act."</p>

<p>All these expressions are somewhat vague, implying,
as it seems, a certain obscurity in Tyndall's
own thought. But it is not atheism. His "cosmical
life" probably is exactly what Cudworth
means by "plastic life." It is well known that
Cudworth, whose great work is a confutation of
all atheism, himself admits what he calls "a plastic
nature" in the universe as a subordinate instrument
of divine Providence. Just as Tyndall
objects to regarding the Deity as "an artificer,"
Cudworth objects to the "mechanic theists," who
make the Deity act directly upon matter from
without, by separate efforts, instead of pouring a
creative and arranging life into nature. We can
easily see that Cudworth, like Tyndall, would
object to Darwin's one or two "primordial germs."
His "plastic nature" is working everywhere and
always, though under a divine guidance. It is "a
life," and therefore incorporeal. It is an unconscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
life, which acts, not knowingly, but fatally.
Man, according to Cudworth, partakes of this life
from the life of the universe, just as he partakes
of heat and cold from the heat and cold of the
universe. Thus Cudworth, believing in some such
"cosmical life" as Tyndall imagines, conceives it
as being itself the organ and instrument of the
Deity. Tyndall, therefore, though less clear in
his statements than Cudworth, is not logically
involved in atheism by those statements, unless we
implicate in the same condemnation the writer
whose vast work constitutes the fullest arsenal of
weapons against all the forms of atheism.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, Tyndall does not come
to any clearness on this point, which in one possessing
such a lucidity of intellect must be occasioned
by his leaving his own domain of science
and venturing into this metaphysical world, with
which he is not so familiar. His acquaintance
with the history of these studies seems not to be
extensive. For example, he attributes to Herbert
Spencer, as if he were the discoverer, what both
Hobbes and Descartes had already stated, that
there is no necessary resemblance between our sensations
and the external objects from which they
are derived. In regard to a belief in God, he tells
us that in his weaker moments he loses it, or that
it becomes clouded and dim, but that when he is
at his best he accepts it most fully. This belief,
therefore, is not with Tyndall a matter of conviction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
founded on reason, but a question of moods.
No wonder, then, that he relegates religion to the
region of sentiment, and declares that it has nothing
to do with knowledge. It must not touch
any question of cosmogony, or, if it does, must "submit
to the control of science" in that field. But
what has science to do with cosmogony? Science
rests on observation of facts; but our professor
tells us that he obtains his great cosmological idea
of "a cosmical life" by prolonging his vision backward
"across the boundary of the experimental evidence."
Such science as this, which is based on
no experience, and is incapable of verification, has
hardly the right to warn religious belief away from
any field.</p>

<p>Tyndall seems a little astray in making creation
and evolution contradictory and incompatible.
Evolution, he tells us, is the manifestation of a
power wholly inscrutable to the intellect of man.
We know that God is,&mdash;that is, we know it in our
better moods,&mdash;but <em>what</em> God is, we cannot ever
know. At all events we must not consider him as
a Creator. "Two courses," says Tyndall, "and
only two, are possible. Either let us open our
doors freely to the conception of creative acts, or,
abandoning them, let us radically change our notions
of matter." His objections to the idea of a
Creator appear to be (1) that it is "derived, not
from the study of Nature, but from the observation
of men;" and (2) that it represents the Deity "as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
an artificer, fashioned after a human model, and
acting by broken efforts as man is seen to act."</p>

<p>Are these objections sound? When we study
man, are we not then also studying Nature? Is
not man himself the highest manifestation of Nature?
If so, and if we see the quality of any
power best in its highest and fullest operations,
we can study the nature of God best by looking
into our own. We should, in fact, know very little
of Nature if we did not look within as well as without.
Tyndall justly demands unlimited freedom of
investigation in the pursuit of science. But whence
came this very idea of freedom except from the
human mind? Nothing in the external world is
free; all is fatal. Such ideas as cause, force, substance,
law, unity, ideality, are not observed in the
outward world&mdash;they are given by the activity of
the mind itself. Subtract these from our thought,
and we should know very little of Nature or its
origin.</p>

<p>No doubt the idea of a Creator, and of one perfect
in wisdom, power, and goodness, is derived by
man from his own mind. But it is not necessary
that such a Creator should be an "artificer," or
proceed by "broken efforts." He may act by
evolution, or processes of development. He may
create perpetually, by a life flowing from himself
into all things. He may create the universe anew
at every moment&mdash;not as a man lights a torch
with a match and then goes away, but as the sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
creates his image in the water by a perpetual process.
Thus God may be regarded as <em>creating</em> each
animal and each plant, while he maintains the mysterious
force of development by which it grows
from its egg or its seed. The essential idea of
creation is an infinite cause, acting according to
a perfect intelligence, for a perfect good. There
is nothing, necessarily, of an artificer or of broken
efforts in this. It is the very idea of divine creation
given in the New Testament. "From whom,
and through whom, and to whom, are all things."
"In him, we live, and move, and have our being."
The theist may well accept the view given by
Goethe, in his little poem, "Gott, Gemüth, und
Welt."</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"What kind of God would He be who only pushes the universe from without?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who lets the All of Things run round and round on his finger?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It becomes him far better to move the universe from within,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take Nature up into Himself, to let Himself down into Nature,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that whatever lives, and moves, and has its being in Him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never loses His power, never misses His spirit."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such a conception of God, as a perpetual Creator,
is essential to the intellectual rest of the human
mind, and it is painful to see the irresolution of
Professor Tyndall in regard to it. "Clear and
confident as Jove" in the domain which is his own,
where his masterly powers of observation, discrimination,
and judgment leave him without a peer,
he seems shorn of his strength on entering this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
field of metaphysics. He has warned theology not
to trespass on the grounds of science; or, if she
enters them, to submit to science as her superior.
Theology has been in the habit of treating science
in the same supercilious way; telling her that she
was an intruder if she ventured to discuss questions
of psychology or religion. This is equally
unwise on either part. Theologians should be glad
when men of science become seriously interested
in these great questions of the Whence and the
Whither. The address of Professor Tyndall is excellent
in its intention as well as in its candid and
manly treatment of the subject. Its indecision
and indistinctness are probably due to his having
accepted too implicitly the guidance of Spencer,
thus assuming that religious truth is unknowable,
that creation is impossible, and that only phenomena
can become objects of knowledge. "Insoluble
mystery" is therefore his final answer to the
questions he has himself raised.</p>

<p>Goethe is wiser when he follows the Apostle
Paul, and regards the Deity as "the fullness which
filleth all in all." There is no unity to thought,
and no hope for scientific progress, more than for
moral culture, unless we see intelligence at the
centre, intelligence on the circumference of being.
To place an impenetrable darkness instead of an
unclouded light on the throne of the universe,
is to throw a shadow over the Creation.</p>

<p>We say that there is no unity in thought without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
this conviction. The only real unity we know
in the world is our own. All we see around us, including
our own body, is divisible, subject to alteration
and change. Only the ego, or soul, is conscious
of a perfect unity in a perpetual identity.
Unless we can attribute to the source of all being
a similar personal unity, there can be no coherence
to science, but it must forever remain fragmentary
and divided. This is what we mean by asserting
the personality of Deity. This idea reaches what
Lord Bacon calls "the vertical point of natural
philosophy" or "the summary law of Nature,"
and constitutes, as he declares, "the union of all
things in a perpetual and uniform law."</p>

<p>And unless we can recognize in the ultimate
fountain of being an intelligent purpose, the meaning
of the universe departs. Without intelligence
in the cause there is none in the effect. Then the
world has no meaning, life no aim. The universe
comes out of darkness, and is plunging into darkness
again.</p>

<p>Take away from the domain of knowledge the
idea of a creating and presiding intelligence, and
there remains no motive for science itself. Professor
Tyndall is sagacious enough to see and candid
enough to admit that "without moral force to whip
it into action the achievements of the intellect
would be poor indeed," and that "science itself
not unfrequently derives motive power from ultra-scientific
sources." Faith in God, as an intelligent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
creator and ruler of the world, has awakened
enthusiasm for scientific investigation among both
the Aryan and the Semitic races.</p>

<p>The purest and highest form of monotheism
is that of Christianity; and in Christendom has
science made its largest progress. Not by martyrs
for science, but by martyrs for religion, has the
human mind been emancipated. Mr. Tyndall says
of scientific freedom, "We fought and won our
battle even in the middle ages." But the heroes
of intellectual liberty have been the heroes of
faith. Hundreds of thousands have died for a
religious creed; but how many have died for a
scientific theory? Luther went to Worms, and
maintained his opinions there in defiance of the
anathemas of the church and the ban of the empire,
but Galileo denied his most cherished convictions
on his knees. Galileo was as noble a character as
Luther; but science does not create the texture of
soul which makes so many martyrs in all the religious
sects of Christendom. Let the doctrine of
cosmical force supplant our faith in the Almighty,
and in a few hundred years science would probably
fade out of the world from pure inanition. The
world would probably not care enough for <em>anything</em>
to care for science. The light of eternity
must fall on this our human and earthly life, to
arouse the soul to a living and permanent interest
even in things seen and temporal.</p>

<p>Professor Tyndall says: "Whether the views of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
Lucretius, Darwin, and Spencer are right or wrong,
we claim the freedom to discuss them. The ground
which they cover is scientific ground."</p>

<p>It is not only a right, but a duty to examine
these theories, since they are held seriously and
urged earnestly by able men. But we must doubt
whether they ought to claim the authority of
science. They are proposed by scientific men, and
they refer to scientific subjects. But these theories,
in their present development, belong to metaphysics
rather than to science. Science consists,
first, of observation of facts; secondly, of laws
inferred from those facts; and thirdly, of a verification
of those laws by new observation and experiment.
That which cannot be verified is no
part of science; astronomy is a science, since every
eclipse and occultation verifies its laws; geology
is a science, since every new observation of the
strata and their contents accords with the established
part of the system; chemistry is a science
for the same reason. But Darwin's theory of the
transformation of species by natural selection is as
yet unverified. "There is no evidence of a direct
descent of earlier from later species in the geological
succession of animals." So says Agassiz, and
on this point his testimony can hardly be impeached.
Professor W. Thompson, another good
geological authority, says: "In successive geological
formations, although new species are constantly
appearing, and there is abundant evidence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
progressive change, no single case has yet been
observed of one species passing through a series of
inappreciable modifications into another." Neither
has any such change taken place within historic
times, for the animals and plants found in the
tombs of Egypt are "identical, in all respects,"
says M. Quatrefages, "with those now existing."
He adds the opinion, after a very careful and candid
examination of the hypothesis of Darwin, that
"the theory and the facts do not agree." Not
being verified, then, this theory is not yet science,
but an unverified mental hypothesis, that is, metaphysics.</p>

<p>It is important that this should be distinctly
said, for when men eminent in science propound
new theories, these theories themselves are apt to
be regarded as science, and those who oppose them
are accused of being opposed to science. This is
the tendency which Professor Tyndall has so justly
described in this very address: "When the human
mind has achieved greatness and given evidence of
power in any domain, there is a tendency to credit
it with similar power in any other domain." Because
Tyndall is great in experimental science,
many are apt to accept his cosmological conclusions.
Because he is a great observer in natural
history, his metaphysical theories are supposed to
be supported by observation, and to rest on experience.
Professor Tyndall's own address terminates,
not in science, but nescience. It treats of a realm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
of atoms and molecules whose existence science
has never demonstrated, and attributes to them
potencies which science has never verified. It is a
system, not made necessary by the stringent constraint
of facts, but avowedly constructed in order
to avoid the belief in an intelligent Creator, and a
universe marked by the presence of design. His
theory, he admits, no less than that of Darwin,
was not constructed in the pure interests of truth
for its own sake. There was another purpose in
both,&mdash;to get rid of a theology of final causes, of a
theology which conceives of God as a human artificer.
He wished to exclude religion from the
field of cosmogony, and forbid it to intrude on the
region of knowledge. Theologians have often been
reproached for studying "with a purpose," but it
seems that this is a frailty belonging not to theologians
only, but to all human beings who care a
good deal for what they believe.</p>

<p>Professor Tyndall accepts religious faith as an
important element of human nature, but considers
it as confined to the sentiments, and as not based
in knowledge. He doubtless comes to this conclusion
from following too implicitly the traditions of
modern English psychology. These assume that
knowledge comes only from without, through the
senses, and never from within, through intuition.
This prepossession, singularly English and insular,
is thus stated by John Stuart Mill in his article on
Coleridge. "Sensation, and the mind's consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
of its own acts, are not only the exclusive
sources, but the sole materials of our knowledge.
There is no knowledge <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i>; no truths cognizable
by the mind's inward light, and grounded on
intuitive evidence." These views have been developed
in England by the two Mills, Herbert
Spencer, Bain, and others, who have made great
efforts to show how sensations may be transformed
into thoughts; how association of ideas may have
developed instincts; how hereditary impressions,
repeated for a million years, may at last have
taken on the aspect of necessary truths. In short,
they have laid out great labor and ingenuity in
proving that a sensation may, very gradually, be
transformed into a thought.</p>

<p>But all this labor is probably a waste of time
and of intellectual power. The attempt at turning
sensation into thought only results in turning
thought into sensation. It is an error that we
only know what we perceive through the senses,
or transform by the action of the mind. It is not
true that we only know that of which we can form
a sensible image. We know the existence of the
soul as certainly as that of the body. We know
the infinite and the eternal as well as we know the
finite and temporal. We know substance, cause,
immortal beauty, absolute truth, as surely as the
flitting phenomena which pass within the sphere
of sensational experience. These convictions belong,
not to the sphere of sentiment and emotion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
but to that of knowledge. It is because they
show us realities and not imaginations, that they
nerve the soul to such vast efforts in the sphere of
morals, literature, and religion.</p>

<p>The arguments against the independent existence
of the soul which Tyndall puts into the
mouth of his Lucretian disciple are not difficult to
answer. "You can form no picture of the soul,"
he says. No; and neither can we form a mental
picture of love or hate, of right and wrong, or
even of bodily pain and pleasure. "If localized
in the body, the soul must have form." Must a
pain, localized in the finger, have form? "When
a leg is amputated, in which part does the soul
reside?" We answer, that the soul resides in the
body, with reduced power. Its instrument is less
perfect than before&mdash;like a telescope which has
lost a lens. "If consciousness is an essential attribute
of the soul, where is the soul when consciousness
ceases by the depression of the brain?"
Is there any difficulty, we reply, in supposing that
the soul may pass sometimes into a state of torpor,
when its instrument is injured? A soul may
sleep, and so be unconscious, without being dead.
"The diseased brain may produce immorality:
can the reason control it? If not, what is the use
of the reason?" To this we answer that the soul
may lose its power with a diseased body; but
when furnished with another and better body, it
will regain it. "If you regard the body only as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
an instrument, you will neglect to take care of it."
Does the astronomer neglect to take care of his
telescope?</p>

<p>These answers to the Lucretian may be far
from complete; but they are at least as good as
the objections. The soul, no doubt, depends on
the body, and cannot do its work well when the
body is out of order; but does that prove it to be
the <em>result</em> of the body? If so, the same argument
would prove the carpenter to be the result of his
box of tools, and the organist to be the result of
his organ. The organist draws sweet music from
his instrument. But as his organ grows old, or is
injured by the weather, or the pipes crack, and the
pedals get out of order, the music becomes more
and more imperfect. At last the instrument is
wholly ruined, and the music wholly ceases. Is,
then, the organist dead, or was he only the result
of the organ? "Without phosphorus, no thought,"
say the materialists. True. So, "without the
organ, no music." Just as in addition to the
musical instrument we need a performer, so in
addition to the brain we need a soul.</p>

<p>There are two worlds of knowledge,&mdash;the outward
world, which is perceived through the senses,
and which belongs to physical science, and the
inward world, perceived by the nobler reason, and
from which a celestial light streams in, irradiating
the mind through all its powers. Religion and
science are not opposed, though different; their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
spheres are different, though not to be divided.
Each is supreme in its own region, but each needs
the help of the other in order to do its own work
well. Professor Tyndall claims freedom of discussion
and inquiry for himself and his scientific
brethren, and says he will oppose to the death any
limitation of this liberty. He need not be anxious
on this point. Religious faith has already fought
this battle, and won for science as well as for itself
perfect liberty of thought. The Protestant
churches may say, "With a great sum obtained
we this freedom." By the lives of its confessors
and the blood of its martyrs has it secured for all
men to-day equal rights of thought and speech.
What neither Copernicus, Kepler, nor Galileo
could do was accomplished by the courage of
Martin Luther, John Calvin, John Knox, and
Oliver Cromwell.</p>

<p>And now the freedom they obtained by such
sacrifices we inherit and enjoy: "We are free-born."
We may be thankful that in most countries
to-day no repression nor dictation prevents
any man from expressing his inmost thought.
We are glad that the most rabid unbelief and
extreme denial can be spoken calmly in the open
day. This is one great discovery of modern times,
that errors lose half their influence when openly
uttered. We owe this discovery to the Reformation.
The reformers made possible a toleration
much larger than their own; unwittingly, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
seeking freedom for their own thoughts, they won
the same freedom for others, who went farther
than they. They builded better than they knew.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Professor Tyndall's address is tranquil yet earnest,
modest, and manly. But its best result is, that
it shows us the impotence of the method of sensation
to explain the mystery of the universe. It
has shown us clearly the limitations of "the understanding
judging by sense"&mdash;shown that it sees
our world clearly, but is blind to the other. It
can tell every blade of grass, and name every
mineral; but it stands helpless and hopeless before
the problem of being. Science and religion
may each say with the apostle, "We know in part
and prophesy in part." Together and united,
they may one day see and know the whole.</p>

<h2 title="LAW AND DESIGN IN NATURE"><a id="LAW">LAW AND DESIGN IN NATURE</a><a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></h2>

<p>In the paper which opens this discussion on
"Law and Design in Nature," Professor Newcomb
announces in a single sentence a proposition, the
truth or falsehood of which, he tells us, is "the sole
question presented for discussion in the present
series of papers."</p>

<p>But, as soon as we examine this proposition, we
find that it contains not one sole question, but
three. The three are independent of each other,
and do not necessarily stand or fall together. They
are <span class="locked">these:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. "The whole course of Nature, considered as
a succession of phenomena, is conditioned solely
by antecedent causes."</p>

<p>2. In the action of these causes, "no regard to
consequences is traceable."</p>

<p>3. And no regard to consequences is "necessary
to foresee the phenomena."</p>

<p>Of these three propositions I admit the truth
of the first; deny the truth of the second; and,
for want of space, and because of its relative unimportance,
leave the third unexamined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
The first proposition is so evidently true, and
so universally admitted, that it was hardly worth
positing for discussion. It is merely affirming that
every natural phenomenon implies a cause. The
word "antecedent" is ambiguous, but, if it intends
logical and not chronological antecedence, it is unobjectionable.
So understood, we are merely asked
if we can accept the law of universal causation;
which I suppose we shall all readily do, since this
law is the basis of theology no less than of science.
Without it, we could not prove the existence of
the first cause. Professor Newcomb has divided
us into two conflicting schools, one of theology
and the other of science. Taking my place in the
school of theology, I think I may safely assert for
my brethren that on this point there is no conflict,
but that we all admit the truth of the law of universal
causation. It will be noticed that Professor
Newcomb has carefully worded his statement, so
as not to confine us to physical causes, nor even
to exclude supernatural causes from without, working
into the nexus of natural laws. He does not
say "antecedent physical causes," nor does he say
"causes which have existed from the beginning."</p>

<p>Admitting thus the truth of the first proposition,
I must resolutely deny that of the second; since,
by accepting it, I should surrender the very cause
I wish to defend, namely, that we can perceive
design in Nature. Final causes are those which
"regard consequences." The principle of finality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
is defined by M. Janet (in his recent exhaustive
work, "Les Causes finales") as "the present determined
by the future." One example of the way
in which we can trace in Nature "a regard to consequences"
is so excellently stated by this eminent
philosopher that we will introduce it here: "Consider
what is implied in the egg of a bird. In the
mystery and night of incubation there comes, by
the combination of an incredible number of causes,
a living machine within the egg. It is absolutely
separated from the external world, but every part
is related to some future use. The outward physical
world which the creature is to inhabit is wholly
divided by impenetrable veils from this internal
laboratory; but a preëstablished harmony exists
between them. Without, there is light; within,
an optical machine adapted to it. Without, there
is sound; within, an acoustic apparatus. Without,
are vegetables and animals; within, organs for
their reception and assimilation. Without, is air;
within, lungs with which to breathe it. Without,
is oxygen; within, blood to be oxygenized. Without,
is earth; within, feet are being made to walk
on it. Without, is the atmosphere; within, are
wings with which to fly through it. Now imagine
a blind and idiotic workman, alone in a cellar, who
simply by moving his limbs to and fro should be
found to have forged a key capable of opening the
most complex lock. If we exclude design, this is
what Nature is supposed to be doing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
That design exists in Nature, and that earthly
phenomena actually depend on final causes as well
as on efficient causes, appears from the industry of
man. Man is certainly a part of Nature, and those
who accept evolution must regard him as the highest
development resulting from natural processes.
Now, all over the earth, from morning till evening,
men are acting for ends. "Regard to consequences
is traceable" in all their conduct. They
are moved by hope and expectation. They devise
plans, and act for a purpose. From the savage
hammering his flint arrowheads, up to a Shakespeare
composing "Hamlet," a Columbus seeking
a new way to Asia, or a Paul converting Europe
to a Syrian religion, human industry is a constant
proof that a large part of the course of Nature on
this earth is the result of design. And, as man
develops into higher stages, this principle of design
rises also from the simple to the complex, taking
ever larger forms. A ship, for instance, shows
throughout the adaptation of means to ends, by
which complex adaptations produce a unity of
result.</p>

<p>And that there is no conflict between the action
of physical causes and final causes is demonstrated
by the works of man, since they all result from the
harmonious action of both. In studying human
works we ask two questions,&mdash;"How?" and
"Why?" We ask, "What is it for?" and "How
is it done?" The two lines of inquiry run parallel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
and without conflict. So, in studying the
works of Nature, to seek for design does not obstruct
the investigation of causes, and may often
aid it. Thus Harvey is said to have been led to
the discovery of the circulation of the blood by
seeking for the use of the valves of the veins and
heart.</p>

<p>The human mind is so constituted that, whenever
it sees an event, it is obliged to infer a cause.
So, whenever it sees adaptation, it infers design.
It is not necessary to know the end proposed, or
who were the agents. Adaptation itself, implying
the use of means, leads us irresistibly to infer intention.
We do not know who built Stonehenge,
or some of the pyramids, or what they were built
for; but no one doubts that they were the result
of design. This inference is strengthened if we
see combination toward an end, and preparation
made beforehand for a result which comes afterward.
From preparation, combination, and adaptation,
we are led to believe in the presence of human
design even where we did not before know
of the presence of human beings. A few rudely
shaped stones, found in a stratum belonging to the
Quaternary period, in which man had before not
been believed to exist, changed that opinion. Those
chipped flints showed adaptation; from adaptation
design was inferred; and design implied the presence
of man.</p>

<p>Now, we find in Nature, especially in the organization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
and instincts of animals, myriads of similar
instances of preparation, combination, and adaptation.
Two explanations only of this occurred to
antiquity,&mdash;design and chance. Socrates, Plato,
and others, were led by such facts to infer the
creation of the world by an intelligent author&mdash;"ille
opifex rerum." Democritus, Epicurus, and
Lucretius, ascribed it to the fortuitous concourse
of atoms. But modern science has expelled chance
from the universe, and substituted law. Laplace,
observing forty-three instances in the solar system
of planets and their satellites revolving on their
axes or moving in their orbits, from west to east,
declared that this could not be a mere coincidence.
Chance, therefore, being set aside, the question
takes another form: "Did the cosmos that we see
come by design or by law?"</p>

<p>But does this really change the question?
Granting, for example, the truth of the theory
of the development of all forms of life, under the
operation of law, from a primal cell, we must then
ask, "Did these <em>laws</em> come by chance or by design?"
It is not possible to evade that issue. If
the universe resulted from non-intelligent forces,
those forces themselves must have existed as the
result of chance or of intelligence. If you put out
the eyes, you leave blindness; if you strike intelligence
out of the creative mystery, you leave blind
forces, the result of accident. Whatever is not
from intelligence is from accident. To substitute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
law for chance is merely removing the difficulty a
little further back; it does not solve it.</p>

<p>To eliminate interventions from the universe is
not to remove design. The most profound theists
have denied such interruptions of the course of Nature.
Leibnitz is an illustrious example of this.
Janet declares him to have been the true author of
the theory of evolution, by his "Law of Continuity,"
of "Insensible Perceptions," and of "Infinitely
Small Increments." Yet he also fully believed
in final causes. Descartes, who objected to some
teleological statements, believed that the Creator
imposed laws on chaos by which the world emerged
into a cosmos. We know that existing animals
are evolved by a continuous process from eggs, and
existing vegetables by a like process from seeds.
No one ever supposed that there was less of design
on this account in their creation. So, if all existing
things came at first by a like process from a
single germ, it would not argue less, but far more,
of design in the universe.</p>

<p>The theory of "natural selection" does not
enable us to dispense with final causes. This
theory requires the existence of forces working
according to the law of heredity and the law of
variation, together with a suitable environment.
But whence came this arrangement, by which a
law of heredity was combined with a law of variation,
and both made to act in a suitable environment?
Here we find again the three marks of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
designing intelligence: preparation, combination,
adaptation. That intelligence which combines and
adapts means to ends is merely remanded to the
initial step of the process, instead of being allowed
to act continuously along the whole line of evolution.
Even though you can explain by the action
of mechanical forces the whole development of the
solar system and its contents from a nebula, you
have only accumulated all the action of a creative
intelligence in the nebula itself. Because I can
explain the mechanical process by which a watch
keeps time, I have not excluded the necessity of a
watchmaker. Because, walking through my neighbor's
grounds, I come upon a water-ram pumping
up water by a purely mechanical process, I do not
argue that this mechanism makes the assumption
of an inventor superfluous. In human industry
we perceive a power capable of using the blind
forces of Nature for an intelligent end; which prepares
beforehand for the intended result; which
combines various conditions suited to produce it,
and so creates order, system, use. But we observe
in Nature exactly similar examples of order, method,
and system, resulting from a vast number of combinations,
correlations, and adaptations of natural
forces. Man himself is such a result. He is an
animal capable of activity, happiness, progress.
But innumerable causes are combined and harmonized
in his physical frame, each necessary to
this end. As the human intelligence is the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
power we know capable of accomplishing such
results, analogy leads us to assume that a similar
intelligence presides over the like combinations of
means to ends in Nature. If any one questions
the value of this argument from analogy, let him
remember how entirely we rely upon it in all the
business of life. We <em>know</em> only the motives which
govern our own actions; but we infer by analogy
that others act from similar motives. Knowing
that we ourselves combine means designed to effect
ends, when we see others adapting means to ends,
we assume that they act also with design. Hence
we have a right to extend the argument further
and higher.</p>

<p>The result of what I have said is this: The
phenomena of the universe cannot be satisfactorily
explained except by the study both of efficient
causes and of final causes. Routine scientists,
confining themselves to the one, and routine theologians,
confining themselves to the other, may
suppose them to be in conflict. But men of larger
insight, like Leibnitz, Newton, Descartes, and
Bacon, easily see the harmony between them.
Like Hegel they say: "Nature is no less artful
than powerful; it attains its end while it allows
all things to act according to their constitution;"
or they declare with Bacon that "the highest link
of Nature's chain is fastened to the foot of Jupiter's
chair." But the belief in final causes does
not imply belief in supernatural intervention, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
of any disturbance in the continuity of natural
processes. It means that Nature is pervaded by
an intelligent presence; that mind is above and
around matter; that mechanical laws are themselves
a manifestation of some providing wisdom,
and that when we say Nature we also say <span class="locked">God.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span></p>

<p>In Thomas Carlyle's earlier days, when he followed
a better inspiration than his present,&mdash;when
his writings were steeped, not in cynicism,
but in the pure human love of his fellow beings,&mdash;in
the days when he did not worship Force, but
Truth and Goodness,&mdash;in those days, it was the
fashion of critics to pass the most sweeping censures
on his writings as "affected," "unintelligible,"
"extravagant." But he worked his way on,
in spite of that superficial criticism,&mdash;he won for
himself an audience; he gained renown; he became
authentic. <em>Now</em>, the same class of critics
admire and praise whatever he writes. For the
rule with most critics is that of the bully in school
and college,&mdash;to tyrannize over the new boys, to
abuse the strangers, but to treat with respect whoever
has bravely fought his way into a recognized
position. Carlyle has fought his way into the position
of a great literary chief,&mdash;so now he may be
ever so careless, ever so willful, and he will be spoken
of in high terms by all monthlies and quarterlies.
When he deserved admiration, he was treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
with cool contempt; now that he deserves the sharpest
criticism, not only for his false moral position,
but for his gross literary sins, the critics treat him
with deference and respect.</p>

<p>But let us say beforehand that we can never
write of Thomas Carlyle with bitterness. We
have received too much good from him in past
days. He is our "Lost Leader," but we have
loved and honored him as few men were ever loved
and honored. It is therefore with tenderness, and
not any cold, indifferent criticism, that we find
fault with him now. We shall always be grateful
to the real Carlyle, the old Carlyle of "Sartor Resartus,"
of the "French Revolution," of the "Life
of Schiller," of "Heroes and Hero-Worship," and
of that long and noble series of articles in the
Edinburgh, Foreign Review, Westminster, and
Frazer, each of which illuminated some theme, and
threw the glory of genius over whatever his mind
touched or his pencil drew.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Carlyle's "Frederick the <span class="locked">Great"<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span> seems to us a
badly written book. Let us consider the volume
containing the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth
chapters. Nothing in these chapters is brought
out clearly. When we have finished the book, the
mind is filled with a confusion of vague images.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
We know that Mr. Carlyle is not bound to "provide
us with brains" as well as with a history, but
neither was he so bound in other days. Yet no
such confusion was left after reading the "French
Revolution." How brilliantly distinct was every
leading event, every influential person, every pathetic
or poetic episode, in that charmed narrative!
Who can forget Carlyle's account of the "Menads,"
the King's "Flight to Varennes," the Constitutions
that "would not march," the "September
Massacres," "Charlotte Corday,"&mdash;every chief
tragic movement, every grotesque episode, moving
forward, distinct and clear, to the final issue, "a
whiff of grapeshot"? Is there anything like that
in this confused "Frederick"?</p>

<p>Compare, for example, the chapters on Voltaire
in the present volume with the article on Voltaire
published in 1829.</p>

<p>The sixteenth book is devoted to the ten years
of peace which followed the second Silesian war.
These were from 1746 to 1756. The book contains
fifteen chapters. Carlyle begins, in chapter
i., by lamenting that there is very little to be
known or said about these ten years. "Nothing
visible in them of main significance but a crash of
authors' quarrels, and the crowning visit of Voltaire."
Yet one would think that matter enough
might be found in describing the immense activity
of Friedrich, of which Macaulay says, "His exertions
were such as were hardly to be expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
from a human body or a human mind." During
these years Frederick brought a seventh part of
his people into the army, and organized and drilled
it under his own personal inspection, till it became
the finest in Europe. He compiled a code of laws,
in which he, among the first, abolished torture.
He made constant journeys through his dominions,
examining the condition of manufactures,
arts, commerce, and agriculture. He introduced
the strictest economy into the expenditures of the
state. He indulged himself, indeed, in various
architectural extravagances at Berlin and Potsdam,&mdash;but
otherwise saved every florin for his
army. He wrote "Memoirs of the House of
Brandenburg," and an epic poem on the "Art of
War." But our author disdains to give us an
account of these things. They are not picturesque,
they can be told in only general terms, and Carlyle
will tell us only what an eyewitness could see or a
listener hear. Accordingly, instead of giving us
an account of these great labors of his hero, he
inserts (chapter ii.) "a peep at Voltaire and his
divine Emilie," "a visit to Frederick by Marshal
Saxe;" (chapter iii.) a long account of Candidate
Linsenbarth's visit to the king; "Sir Jonas
Hanway stalks across the scene;" the lawsuit of
Voltaire about the Jew Hirsch; "a demon news-writer
gives an idea of Friedrich;" the quarrel of
Voltaire and Maupertuis; "Friedrich is visible in
Holland to the naked eye for some minutes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
This is very unsatisfactory. Reports of eyewitnesses
are, no doubt, picturesque and valuable; but
so only on condition of being properly arranged,
and tending, in their use, toward some positive
result. Then the tone of banter, of irony, almost
of persiflage, is discouraging. If the whole story
of Friedrich is so unintelligible, uninteresting, or
incommunicable, why take the trouble to write it?
The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">poco-curante</i> air with which he narrates, as
though it were of no great consequence whether he
told his story or not, contrasts wonderfully with
his early earnestness. Carlyle writes this history
like a man thoroughly <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">blasé</i>. Impossible for him
to take any interest in it himself,&mdash;how, then, does
he expect to interest us? Has he not himself told
us, in his former writings, that the man who
proposes to teach others anything must be good
enough to believe it first himself?</p>

<p>Here is the problem we have to solve. How
came this change from the Carlyle of the Past to
the Carlyle of the Present,&mdash;from Carlyle the
universal believer to Carlyle the universal skeptic,&mdash;from
him to whom the world was full of wonder
and beauty, to him who can see in it nothing but
Force on the one side and Shams on the other?
What changed that tender, loving, brave soul into
this hard cynic? And how was it, as Faith and
Love faded out of him, that the life passed from
his thought, the glory from his pen, and the
page, once alive with flashing ideas, turned into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
this confused heap of rubbish, in which silver
spoons, old shoes, gold sovereigns, and copper pennies
are pitched out promiscuously, for the patient
reader to sift and pick over as he can? In reading
the Carlyle of thirty years ago, we were like
California miners,&mdash;come upon a rich <em>placer</em>,
never before opened, where we could all become
rich in a day. Now the reader of Carlyle is a
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chiffonier</i>, raking in a heap of street dust for whatever
precious matters may turn up.</p>

<p>To investigate this question is our purpose now,&mdash;and
in doing so we will consider, in succession,
these two Carlyles.</p>

<p>I. It was about the year 1830 that readers of
books in this vicinity became aware of a new power
coming up in the literary republic. Opinions concerning
him varied widely. To some he seemed a
Jack Cade, leader of rebels, foe to good taste and all
sound opinions. Especially did his admiration for
Goethe and for German literature seem to many
preposterous and extravagant. It was said of
these, that "the force of folly could no further
go,"&mdash;that they "constituted a burlesque too
extravagant to be amusing." The tone of Carlyle
was said to be of "unbounded assumption;" his
language to be "obscure and barbarous;" his
ideas composed of "extravagant paradoxes, familiar
truths or familiar falsehoods;" "wildest extravagance
and merest silliness."</p>

<p>But to others, and especially to the younger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
men, this new writer came, opening up unknown
worlds of beauty and wonder. A strange influence,
unlike any other, attracted us to his writing.
Before we knew his name, we knew <em>him</em>. We
could recognize an article by our new author as
soon as we opened the pages of the Foreign Review,
Edinburgh, or Westminster, and read a few
paragraphs. But it was not the style, though
marked by a singular freedom and originality&mdash;not
the tone of kindly humor, the good-natured
irony, the happy illustrations brought from afar,&mdash;not
the amount of literary knowledge, the familiarity
with German, French, Italian, Spanish
literature,&mdash;not any or all of these which so bewitched
us. We knew a young man who used to
walk from a neighboring town to Boston every
week, in order to read over again two articles by
Carlyle in two numbers of the Foreign Review
lying on a table in the reading-room of the Athenæum.
This was his food, in the strength of
which he could go a week, till hunger drove him
back to get another meal at the same table. We
knew other young men and young women who
taught themselves German in order to read for
themselves the authors made so luminous by this
writer. Those were counted fortunate who possessed
the works of our author, as yet unpublished
in America,&mdash;his "Life of Schiller," his "German
Romance," his Review articles. What, then,
was the charm,&mdash;whence the fascination?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
To explain this we must describe a little the
state of literature and opinion in this vicinity at
the time when Carlyle's writings first made their
appearance.</p>

<p>Unitarianism and Orthodoxy had fought their
battle, and were resting on their arms. Each had
intrenched itself in certain positions, each had won
to its side most of those who legitimately belonged
to it. Controversy had done all it could, and had
come to an end. Among the Unitarians, the so-called
"practical preaching" was in vogue; that
is, ethical and moral essays, pointing out the goodness
of being good, and the excellence of what was
called "moral virtue." There was, no doubt, a
body of original thinkers and writers,&mdash;better
thinkers and writers, it may be, than we have now,&mdash;who
were preparing the way for another advance.
Channing had already unfolded his doctrine
of man, of which the central idea is, that
human nature is not to be moulded by religion,
but to be developed by it. Walker, Greenwood,
Ware, and their brave associates, were conducting
this journal with unsurpassed ability. But something
more was needed. The general character of
preaching was not of a vitalizing sort. It was
much like what Carlyle says of preaching in England
at the same period: "The most enthusiastic
Evangelicals do not preach a Gospel, but keep
describing how it should and might be preached;
to awaken the sacred fire of faith is not their endeavor;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
but at most, to describe how faith shows
and acts, and scientifically to distinguish true faith
from false." It is "not the Love of God which is
taught, but the love of the Love of God."</p>

<p>According to this, God was outside of the world,
at a distance from his children, and obliged to
communicate with them in this indirect way, by
breaking through the walls of natural law with an
occasional miracle. There was no door by which
he could enter into the sheepfold to his sheep.
Miracles were represented, even by Dr. Channing,
as abnormal, as "violations of the laws of nature;"
something, therefore, unnatural and monstrous,
and not to be believed except on the best evidence.
God could not be supposed to break through the
walls of this house of nature, except in order to
speak to his children on some great occasions.
That he had done it, in the case of Christianity,
could be proved by the eleven volumes of Dr.
Lardner, which showed the Four Gospels to have
been written by the companions of Christ, and not
otherwise.</p>

<p>The whole of this theory rested, it will be observed,
on a sensuous system of mental philosophy.
"All knowledge comes through the senses," was
its foundation. Revelation, like every other form
of knowledge, must come through the senses. A
miracle, which appeals to the sight, touch, hearing,
is the only possible proof of a divine act. For,
in the last analysis, all our theology rests on our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
philosophy. Theology, being belief, must proceed
according to those laws of belief, whatever
they are, which we accept and hold. The man
who thinks that all knowledge comes through the
senses must receive his theological knowledge also
that way, and no other. This was the general
opinion thirty or forty years ago; hence this theory
of Christianity, which supposes that God is
obliged to break his own laws in order to communicate
it.</p>

<p>But the result of this belief was harmful. It
tended to make our religion formal, our worship
a mere ceremony; it made real communication
with God impossible; it turned prayer into a
self-magnetizing operation; it left us virtually
"without God and hope in the world." Thanks
to Him who never leaves himself without a witness
in the human heart, this theory was often nullified
in practice by the irrepressible instincts which it
denied, by the spiritual intuitions which it ridiculed.
Even Professor Norton, its chief champion,
had a heart steeped in the sweetest piety. Denying,
intellectually, all intuitions of God, Duty,
and Immortality, his beautiful and tender hymns
show the highest spiritual insight. Still it cannot
be denied that this theory tended to dry up the
fountains of religious faith in the human heart,
and to leave us in a merely mechanical and unspiritualized
world.</p>

<p>Now the first voice which came to break this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
enchantment was, to many, the voice of Thomas
Carlyle. It needed for this end, it always needs,
a man who could come face to face with Truth.
Every great idol-breaker, every man who has delivered
the world from the yoke of Forms, has
been one who was able to see the substance of
things, who was gifted with the insight of realities.
Forms of worship, forms of belief, at first the
channels of life, through which the Living Spirit
flowed into human hearts, at last became petrified,
incrusted, choked. A few drops of the vital
current still ooze slowly through them, and our
parched lips, sucking these few drops, cling all the
more closely to the form as it becomes less and
less a vehicle of life. The poorest word, old and
trite, is precious when there is no open vision.
We do well continually to resort to the half-dead
form, "till the day dawn, and the day-star arise in
our hearts."</p>

<p>But at last there comes a man capable of dispensing
with the form,&mdash;a man endowed with a
high degree of the intuitive faculty,&mdash;a born seer,
a prophet, seeing the great realities of the universe
with open vision. The work of such a man is to
break up the old formulas and introduce new light
and life. This work was done for the Orthodox
thirty years ago by the writings of Coleridge; for
the Unitarians in this vicinity, by the writings of
Thomas Carlyle.</p>

<p>This was the secret of the enthusiasm felt for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Carlyle, in those days, by so many of the younger
men and women. He taught us to look at realities
instead of names, at substance instead of surface,&mdash;to
see God in the world, in nature, in life,
in providence, in man,&mdash;to see divine truth and
beauty and wonder everywhere around. He taught
that the only organ necessary by which to see the
divine in all things was sincerity, or inward truth.
And so he enabled us to escape from the form into
the spirit, he helped us to rise to that plane of
freedom from which we could see the divine in the
human, the infinite in the finite, God in man,
heaven on earth, immortality beginning here, eternity
pervading time. This made for us a new
heaven and a new earth, a new religion and a new
life. Faith was once more possible, a faith not
bought by the renunciation of mature reason or
the beauty and glory of the present hour.</p>

<p>But all this was taught us by our new prophet,
not by the intellect merely, but by the spirit in
which he spoke. He did not seem to be giving us
a new creed, so much as inspiring us with a new
life. That which came from his experience went
into ours. Therefore it might have been difficult,
in those days, for any of his disciples to state what
it was that they had learned from him. They had
not learned his doctrine,&mdash;they had absorbed it.
Hence, very naturally, came the imitations of
Carlyle, which so disgusted the members of the
old school. Hence the absurd Carlylish writing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
the feeble imitations by honest, but weak disciples
of the great master. It was a pity, but not unnatural,
and it soon passed by.</p>

<p>As Carlyle thus did his work, not so much
by direct teaching as by an influence hidden in
all that he said, it did not much matter on what
subject he wrote,&mdash;the influence was there still.
But his articles on Goethe were the most attractive,
because he asserted that in this patriarch of
German literature he had found one who saw in
all things their real essence, one whose majestic
and trained intelligence could interpret to us in all
parts of nature and life the inmost quality, the
<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">terza essenza</i>, as the Italian Platonists called it,
which made each itself. Goethe was announced
as the prophet of Realism. He, it should seem,
had perfectly escaped from words into things. He
saw the world, not through dogmas, traditions,
formulas, but as it was in itself. To him</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i6q">"the world's unwithered countenance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was fresh as on creation's day."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Consider the immense charm of such hopes as
these! No wonder that the critics complained
that the disciples of Carlyle were "insensible to
ridicule." What did they care for the laughter,
which seemed to them, in their enthusiasm, like
"the crackling of thorns under the pot." Ridicule,
in fact, never touches the sincere enthusiast.
It is a good and useful weapon against affectation,
but it falls, shivered to pieces, from the magic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
breastplate of truth. No sincere person, at work
in a cause which he knows to be important, ever
minds being laughed at.</p>

<p>But besides his admirable discussions of Goethe,
Carlyle's "Life of Schiller" opened the portals of
German literature, and made an epoch in biography
and criticism. It was a new thing to read a
biography written with such enthusiasm,&mdash;to find
a critic who could really write with reverence and
tender love of the poet whom he criticised. Instead
of taking his seat on the judicial bench, and
calling his author up before him to be judged as
a culprit, Carlyle walks with Schiller through the
circles of his poems and plays, as Dante goes with
Virgil through the Inferno and Paradiso. He
accepts the great poet as his teacher and <span class="locked">master,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span>
a thing unknown before in all criticism. It was
supposed that a biographer would become a mere
Boswell if he looked up to his hero, instead of
looking down on him. It was not understood that
it was that "angel of the world," Reverence,
which had exalted even a poor, mean, vain fool,
like Boswell, and enabled him to write one of the
best books ever written. It was not his reverence
for Johnson which made Boswell a fool,&mdash;his
reverence for Johnson made him, a fool, capable of
writing one of the best books of modern times.</p>

<p>This capacity of reverence in Carlyle&mdash;this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
power of perceiving a divine, infinite quality in
human souls&mdash;tinges all his biographical writing
with a deep religious tone. He wrote of Goethe,
Schiller, Richter, Burns, Novalis, even Voltaire,
with reverence. He could see their defects easily
enough, he could playfully expose their weaknesses;
but beneath all was the sacred undertone of reverence
for the divine element in each,&mdash;for that
which God had made and meant them to be, and
which they had realized more or less imperfectly
in the struggle of life. The difference between
the reverence of a Carlyle and that of a Boswell
is, that one is blind and the other intelligent. The
one worships his hero down to his shoes and stockings,
the other distinguishes the divine idea from
its weak embodiment.</p>

<p>Two articles from this happy period&mdash;that on
the "Signs of the Times" and that called "Characteristics"&mdash;indicate
some of Carlyle's leading
ideas concerning right thinking and right living.
In the first, he declares the present to be an age
of mechanism,&mdash;not heroic, devout, or philosophic.
All things are done by machinery. "Men
have no faith in individual endeavor or natural
force." "Metaphysics has become material."
Government is a machine. All this he thinks
evil. The living force is in the individual soul,&mdash;not
mechanic, but dynamic. Religion is a calculation
of expediency, not an impulse of worship; no
thousand-voiced psalm from the heart of man to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
invisible Father, the Fountain of all goodness,
beauty, and truth, but a contrivance by which a
small quantum of earthly enjoyment may be exchanged
for a much larger quantum of celestial
enjoyment. "Virtue is pleasure, is profit." "In
all senses we worship and follow after power, which
may be called a physical pursuit." (Ah, Carlyle
of the Present! does not that wand of thine old
true self touch thee?) "No man now loves truth,
as truth must be loved, with an infinite love; but
only with a finite love, and, as it were, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par amours</i>."</p>

<p>In the other article, "Characteristics," printed
two years later, in 1831, he unfolds the doctrine of
"Unconsciousness" as the sign of health in soul
as well as body. He finds society sick everywhere;
he finds its religion, literature, science, all
diseased, yet he ends the article, as the other was
ended, in hope of a change to something better.</p>

<p>These two articles may be considered as an introduction
to his next great work, "Sartor Resartus,"
or the "Clothes-Philosophy." Here, in a
vein of irony and genial humor, he unfolds his
doctrine of substance and form. The object of all
thought and all experience is to look through
the clothes to the living beneath them. According
to his book, all human institutions are the
clothing of society; language is the garment of
thought, the heavens and earth the time-vesture
of the Eternal. So, too, are religious creeds and
ceremonies the clothing of religion; so are all symbols<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
the vesture of some idea; so are the crown
and sceptre the vesture of government. This book
is the autobiography of a seeker for truth. In it
he is led from the shows of things to their innermost
substance, and as in all his other writings, he
teaches here also that sincerity, truthfulness, is the
organ by which we are led to the solid rock of
reality, which underlies all shows and shams.</p>

<p>II. We now come to treat of Carlyle in his present
aspect,&mdash;a much less agreeable task. We
leave Carlyle the generous and gentle, for Carlyle
the hard cynic. We leave him, the friend of man,
lover of his race, for another Carlyle, advocate of
negro slavery, worshiper of mere force, sneering
at philanthropy, and admiring only tyrants, despots,
and slaveholders. The change, and the steps
which led to it, chronologically and logically, it is
our business to scrutinize,&mdash;not a grateful occupation
indeed, but possibly instructive and useful.</p>

<p>Thomas Carlyle, after spending his previous life
in Scotland, and from 1827 to 1834 in his solitude
at Craigenputtoch, removed to London in the latter
year, when thirty-eight years old. Since then he
has permanently resided in London, in a house
situated on one of the quiet streets running at
right angles with the Thames. He came to London
almost an unknown man; he has there become
a great name and power in literature. He has had
for friends such men as John Stuart Mill, Sterling,
Maurice, Leigh Hunt, Browning, Thackeray, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
Emerson. His "French Revolution" was published
in 1837; "Sartor Resartus" (published
in Frazer in 1833, and in Boston in a volume in
1836) was put forth collectively in 1838; and
in the same year his "Miscellanies" (also collected
and issued in Boston in 1838) were published in
London, in four volumes. "Chartism" was issued
in 1839. He gave four courses of Lectures in
Willis's rooms "to a select but crowded audience,"
in 1837, 1838, 1839, and 1840. Only the last of
these&mdash;"Heroes and Hero-Worship"&mdash;was published.
"Past and Present" followed in 1843,
"Oliver Cromwell" in 1845. In 1850 he printed
"Latter-Day Pamphlets," and subsequently his
"Life of Sterling" (1851), and the four volumes,
now issued, of "Frederick the Great."</p>

<p>The first evidence of an altered tendency is perhaps
to be traced in the "French Revolution."
It is a noble and glorious book; but, as one of his
friendly critics has said, "its philosophy is contemptuous
and mocking, and it depicts the varied
and gigantic characters which stalk across the
scene, not so much as responsible and living mortals,
as the mere mechanical implements of some
tremendous and irresistible destiny." In "Heroes
and Hero-Worship" the habit has grown of revering
mere will, rather than calm intellectual and
moral power. The same thing is shown in "Past
and Present," in "Cromwell," and in "Latter-Day
Pamphlets," which the critic quoted above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
says is "only remarkable as a violent imitation of
himself, and not of his better self." For the works
of this later period, indeed, the best motto would
be that verse from Daniel: "He shall exalt himself,
and magnify himself, and speak marvelous
things; neither shall he regard the God of his
fathers, but in his stead shall he honor the God
of Forces, a god whom his fathers knew not."</p>

<p>Probably this apostasy from his better faith had
begun, before this, to show itself in conversation.
At least Margaret Fuller, in a letter dated 1846,
finds herself in his presence admiring his brilliancy,
but "disclaiming and rejecting almost
everything he said." "For a couple of hours,"
says she, "he was talking about poetry, and the
whole harangue was one eloquent proclamation of
the defects in his own mind." "All Carlyle's talk,
another evening," says she, "was a defence of mere
force,&mdash;success the test of right; if people would
not behave well, put collars round their necks;
find a hero, and let them be his slaves." "Mazzini
was there, and, after some vain attempts to
remonstrate, became very sad. Mrs. Carlyle said
to me, 'These are but opinions to Carlyle; but to
Mazzini, who has given his all, and helped bring
his friends to the scaffold, in pursuit of such subjects,
it is a matter of life and death.'"</p>

<p>As this mood of Mr. Carlyle comes out so
strongly in the "Latter-Day Pamphlets," it is perhaps
best to dwell on them at greater leisure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
The first is "The Present Time." In this he
describes Democracy as inevitable, but as utterly
evil; calls for a government; finds most European
governments, that of England included, to be shams
and falsities,&mdash;no-government, or drifting, to be a
yet greater evil. The object, he states, is to find
the noblest and best men to govern. Democracy
fails to do this; for universal balloting is not adequate
to the task. Democracy answered in the old
republics, when the mass were slaves, but will not
answer now. The United States are no proof of
its success, for (1st) anarchy is avoided merely by
the quantity of cheap land, and (2d) the United
States have produced no spiritual results, but only
material. Democracy in America is no-government,
and "its only feat is to have produced eighteen
millions of the greatest <em>bores</em> ever seen in the
world." Mr. Carlyle's plan, therefore, is to find,
somehow, the <em>best man</em> for a ruler, to make him a
despot, to make the mass of the English and Irish
slaves, to beat them if they will not work, to shoot
them if they still refuse. The only method of finding
this best man, which he suggests, is to <em>call for
him</em>. Accordingly, Mr. Thomas Carlyle <em>calls</em>, saying,
"Best man, come forward, and govern."</p>

<p>The sum, therefore, of his recipe for the diseases
of the times is <span class="smcap">Slavery</span>.</p>

<p>The second pamphlet is called "Model Prisons,"
and the main object of this is to ridicule all attempts
at helping men by philanthropy or humanity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
The talk of "Fraternity" is nonsense, and
must be drummed out of the world. Beginning
with model prisons, he finds them much too good
for the "scoundrels" who are shut up there. He
would have them whipped and hung (seventy
thousand in a year, we suppose, as in bluff King
Harry's time, with no great benefit therefrom).
"Revenge," he says, "is a right feeling against bad
men,&mdash;only the excess of it wrong." The proper
thing to say to a bad man is, "Caitiff, I hate thee."
"A collar round the neck, and a cart-whip over
the back," is what he thinks would be more just to
criminals than a model prison. The whole effort
of humanity should be to help the industrious and
virtuous poor; the criminals should be swept out of
the way, whipt, enslaved, or hung. As for human
brotherhood, he does not admit brotherhood with
"scoundrels." Particularly disgusting to him is it
to hear this philanthropy to bad men called Christianity.
Christianity, he thinks, does not tell us to
love the bad, but to hate them as God hates them.
According, probably, to his private expurgated
version of the Gospel, "that ye may be the children
of your Father in heaven, whose sun rises
only on the good, and whose rain falls only on the
just."</p>

<p>"Downing Street" and "New Downing Street"
are fiery tirades against the governing classes in
England. Mr. Carlyle says (according to his inevitable
refrain), that England does not want a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
reformed Parliament, a body of talkers, but a
reformed Downing Street, a body of workers. He
describes the utter imbecility of the English government,
and calls loudly for some able man to
take its place. Two passages are worth quoting;
the first as to England's aspect in her foreign relations,
which is quite as true for 1864 as for 1854.</p>

<p>"How it stands with the Foreign Office, again,
one still less knows. Seizures of Sapienza, and the
like sudden appearances of Britain in the character
of Hercules-Harlequin, waving, with big bully-voice,
her sword of sharpness over field-mice, and
in the air making horrid circles (horrid Catherine-wheels
and death-disks of metallic terror from said
huge sword) to see how they will like it. Hercules-Harlequin,
the Attorney Triumphant, the
World's Busybody!"</p>

<p>Or see the following description of the sort of
rulers who prevail in England, no less than in
<span class="locked">America:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"If our government is to be a No-Government,
what is the matter who administers it? Fling an
orange-skin into St. James Street, let the man it
hits be your man. He, if you bend him a little to
it, and tie the due official bladders to his ankles,
will do as well as another this sublime problem of
balancing himself upon the vortexes, with the long
loaded pole in his hand, and will, with straddling,
painful gestures, float hither and thither, walking
the waters in that singular manner for a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
while, till he also capsize, and be left floating feet
uppermost,&mdash;after which you choose another."</p>

<p>Concerning which we may say, that if this is the
result of monarchy and aristocracy in England,
we can stick a little longer to our democracy in
America. Mr. Carlyle says that the object of all
these methods is to find the ablest man for a ruler.
He thinks our republican method very insufficient
and absurd,&mdash;much preferring the English system,&mdash;and
then tells us that this is the outcome
of the latter; that you might as well select your
ruler by throwing an orange-skin into the street as
by the method followed in England.</p>

<p>Despotism, tempered by assassination, seems to
be Carlyle's notion of a good government.</p>

<p>The pamphlet "Stump-Orator" is simply a bitter
denunciation of all talking, speech-making,
and writing, as the curse of the time, and ends with
the proposition to cut out the tongues of one whole
generation, as an act of mercy to them and a blessing
to the human race.</p>

<p>Thus this collection of "Latter-Day Pamphlets"
consists of the bitterest cynicism. Carlyle sits in
it, as in a tub, snarling at freedom, yelping at philanthropy,
growling at the English government,
snapping at all men who speak or write, and ending
with one long howl over the universal falsity
and hollowness of mankind in general.</p>

<p>After which he proceeds to his final apotheosis
of despotism pure and simple, in this "Life of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Frederick the Great." Of this it is not necessary
to say more than that Frederick, being an absolute
despot, but a very able one, having plunged Europe
into war in order to steal Silesia, is everywhere
admired, justified, or excused by Carlyle,
who reserves his rebukes and contempt for those
who find fault with all this.</p>

<p>That, with these opinions, Carlyle should have
taken sides with the slaveholders' conspiracy
against the Union is not surprising. His sympathies
were with them; first, as slaveholders,
secondly, as aristocrats. He hates us because we
are democrats, and he loves them because they are
despots and tyrants. Long before the outbreak of
the rebellion, he had ridiculed emancipation, and
denounced as folly and evil the noblest deed of
England,&mdash;the emancipation of her West India
slaves. In scornful, bitter satire, he denounced
England for keeping the fast which God had chosen,
in undoing the heavy burdens, letting the
oppressed go free, and breaking every yoke. He
ridiculed the black man, and described the poor
patient African as "Quashee, steeped to the eyes
in pumpkin." In the hateful service of oppression
he had already done his best to uphold slavery and
discourage freedom. And while he fully believed
in enslaving the laboring population, black or white,
and driving it to work by the cart-whip, he as fully
abhorred republicanism everywhere, and most of
all in the United States. He had exhausted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
resources of language in vilifying American institutions.
It was a matter of course, therefore, that
at the outbreak of this civil war all his sympathies
should be with those who whip women and sell
babies.</p>

<p>How is it that this great change should have
taken place? Men change,&mdash;but not often in
this way. The ardent reformer often hardens into
the stiff conservative. The radical in religion is
very likely to join the Catholic Church. If a
Catholic changes his religion, he goes over to
atheism. To swing from one extreme to another,
is a common experience. But it is a new thing to
see calmness in youth, violence in age,&mdash;to find
the young man wise and all-sided, the old man
bigoted and narrow.</p>

<p>We think the explanation to be this.</p>

<p>Thomas Carlyle from the beginning has not
shown the least appreciation of the essential thing
in Christianity. Brought up in Scotland, inheriting
from Calvinism a sense of truth, a love of
justice, and a reverence for the Jewish Bible, he
has never passed out of Judaism into Christianity.
To him, Oliver Cromwell is the best type of true
religion; inflexible justice the best attribute of
God or man. He is a worshiper of Jehovah, not
of the God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ.
He sees in God truth and justice; he does not see
in him love. He is himself a prophet after the
type of Elijah and John the Baptist. He is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
voice crying in the wilderness; and we may say of
him, therefore, as was said of his prototype, "He
was a burning and a shining light, and ye were
willing, for a season, to rejoice in his light,"&mdash;but
not always,&mdash;not now.</p>

<p>Carlyle does not, indeed, claim to be a Jew, or
to reject Christ. On the contrary, he speaks of
him with very sincere respect. He seems, however,
to know nothing of him but what he has read
in Goethe about the "worship of sorrow." The
Gospel appears to him to be, essentially, a worship
of sorrow. That Christ "came to save sinners,"&mdash;of
that Carlyle has not the faintest idea. To
him the notion of "saving sinners" is only "rose-water
philanthropy." He does not wish them
saved, he wishes them damned,&mdash;swept into hell
as soon as convenient.</p>

<p>But, as everything which is real has two sides,
that of <em>truth</em> and that of <em>love</em>,&mdash;it usually happens
that he who only sees <em>one</em> side at last ceases even
to see that. All goodness, to Carlyle, is truth,&mdash;in
man it is sincerity, or love of reality, sight of
the actual facts,&mdash;in God it is justice, divine
adherence to law, infinite guidance of the world
and of every human soul according to a strict and
inevitable rule of righteousness. At first this
seems to be a providence,&mdash;and Carlyle has
everywhere, in the earlier epoch, shown full confidence
in Providence. But believe only in justice
and truth,&mdash;omit the doctrine of forgiveness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
redemption, salvation,&mdash;and faith in Providence
becomes sooner or later a despairing fatalism.
The dark problem of evil remains insoluble without
the doctrine of redemption.</p>

<p>So it was that Carlyle, seeing at first the chief
duty of man to be the worship of reality, the love
of truth, next made that virtue to consist in
sincerity, or being in earnest. Truth was being
true to one's self. In this lay the essence of heroism.
So that Burns, being sincere and earnest,
was a hero,&mdash;Odin was a hero,&mdash;Mohammed
was a hero,&mdash;Cromwell was a hero,&mdash;Mirabeau
and Danton were heroes,&mdash;and Frederick the
Great was a hero. That which was first the love
of truth, and caused him to reverence the calm
intellectual force of Schiller and Goethe, soon
became earnestness and sincerity, and then became
power. For the proof of earnestness is power.
So from power, by eliminating all love, all tenderness,
as being only rose-water philanthropy, he at
last became a worshiper of mere will, of force in
its grossest form. So he illustrates those lines of
Shakespeare in which this process is so well described.
In "Troilus and Cressida" Ulysses is
insisting on the importance of keeping everything
in its place, and giving to the best things and
persons their due priority. Otherwise, mere force
will govern all things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p><div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"Strength would be lord of imbecility,"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">as Carlyle indeed openly declares that it ought to
<span class="locked">be,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"And the rude son should strike his father dead,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">which Carlyle does not quite approve of in the
case of Dr. Francia. But why not, if he maintains
that strength is the measure of justice?</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"Force should be right; or, rather, right and wrong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Between whose endless jar justice resides)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should lose their names and so should justice, too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Then everything includes itself in power,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Power into will, will into appetite;</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>And appetite, an universal wolf,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>So doubly seconded with will and power,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Must make perforce an universal prey,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>And, last, eat up himself.</em>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Just so, in the progress of Carlyle's literary
career, first, force became right,&mdash;then, everything
included itself in power,&mdash;next, power was
lost in will, and will in mere caprice or appetite.
From his admiration for Goethe, as the type of
intellectual power, he passed to the praise of
Cromwell as the exponent of will, and then to that
of Frederick, whose appetite for plunder and territory
was seconded by an iron will and the highest
power of intellect; but whose ambition devoured
himself, his country, and its prosperity, in the mad
pursuit of victory and conquest.</p>

<p>The explanation, therefore, of our author's lapse,
is simply this, that he worshiped truth divorced
from love, and so ceased to worship truth, and fell
into the idolatry of mere will. Truth without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
love is not truth, but hard, willful opinion, just as
love without truth is not love, but weak good-nature
and soft concession.</p>

<p>Carlyle has no idea of that sublime feature of
Christianity, which shows to us God caring more
for the one sinner who repents than the ninety
and nine just persons which need no repentance.
To him one just person deserves more care than
ninety-nine sinners. Yet it is strange that he did
not learn from his master, Goethe, this essential
trait of the Gospel. For Goethe, in a work translated
by Carlyle himself, distinguishes between
the three religions thus. The ethnic or Gentile
religions, he says, reverence <em>what is above us</em>,&mdash;the
religion of the philosopher reverences <em>what is
on our own level</em>,&mdash;but Christianity reverences
<em>what is beneath us</em>. "This is the last step," says
Goethe, "which mankind were destined to attain,&mdash;to
recognize humility and poverty, mockery
and despite, disgrace and wretchedness, as divine,&mdash;nay,
<em>even on sin and crime to look not as hindrances,
but to honor and love them as furtherances
of what is holy</em>."</p>

<p>On sin and crime, as we have seen, Carlyle
looks with no such tenderness. But if he does not
care for the words of Christ, teaching us that we
must forgive if we hope to be forgiven, if he does
not care for the words of his master, Goethe, he
might at least remember his own exposition of this
doctrine in an early work, where he shows that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
poor left to perish by disease infect a whole community,
and declares that the safety of all is involved
in the safety of the humblest.</p>

<p>In 1840, when he wrote "Chartism," Carlyle
seems to have known better than he did in 1855,
when he wrote these "Latter-Day Pamphlets."
<em>Then</em> he <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"To believe practically that the poor and luckless
are here only as a nuisance to be abraded and
abated, and in some permissible manner made
away, and swept out of sight, is not an amiable
faith."</p>

<p>Of Ireland, too, he <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"We English pay, even now, the bitter smart
of long centuries of injustice to Ireland." "It is
the feeling of <em>injustice</em> that is insupportable to
all men. The brutalest black African feels it,
and cannot bear that he should be used unjustly.
No man can bear it, or ought to bear it."</p>

<p>This seems like the "rose-water philanthropy"
which he subsequently so much disliked. In this
book also he speaks of a "seven years' Silesian
robber-war,"&mdash;we trust not intending to call his
beloved Frederick a robber! And again he proposes,
as one of the best things to be done
in England, to have all the people taught by
government to read and write,&mdash;the same thing
which this American democracy, in which he could
see not one good thing, has so long been doing.
That was the plan by which England was to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
saved,&mdash;a plan first suggested in England in
1840,&mdash;adopted and acted on in America for two
hundred years.</p>

<p>But just as love separated from truth becomes
cruelty, so <em>truth</em> by itself&mdash;truth <em>not</em> tempered
and fulfilled by love&mdash;runs sooner or later into
falsehood. <em>Truth</em>, after a while, becomes dogmatism,
overbearing assertion, willful refusal to see
and hear other than one's own belief; that is to
say, it becomes falsehood. Such has been the case
with our author. On all the subjects to which
he has committed himself he closes his eyes, and
refuses to see the other side. Like his own symbol,
the mighty Bull, he makes his charge <em>with his
eyes shut</em>.</p>

<p>Determined, for example, to rehabilitate such
men as Mirabeau, Cromwell, Frederick, and Frederick's
father, he does thorough work, and defends
or excuses all their enormities, palliating whenever
he cannot justify.</p>

<p>What can we call this which he <span class="locked">says<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span> concerning
the execution of Lieutenant Katte, by order of old
King Friedrich Wilhelm? Tired of the tyranny
of his father, tired of being kicked and caned, the
young prince tried to escape. He was caught and
held as a deserter from the army, and his father
tried to run him through the body. Lieutenant
Katte, who had aided him in getting away, having
been kicked and caned, was sent to a court-martial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
to be tried. The court-martial found him guilty
not of deserting, but of intending to desert, and
sentenced him to two years' imprisonment. Whereupon
the king went into a rage, declared that Katte
had committed high treason, and ordered him to be
executed. Whereupon Carlyle thus <span class="locked">writes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"'Never was such a transaction before or since
in modern history,' cries the angry reader; 'cruel,
like the grinding of human hearts under millstones;
like&mdash;&mdash;' Or, indeed, like the doings of the gods,
which are cruel, but not that alone."</p>

<p>In other words, Carlyle cannot make up his mind
frankly to condemn this atrocious murder, and call
it by its right name. He must needs try to sophisticate
us by talking about "the doings of the
gods." Because Divine Providence takes men out
of the world in various ways, it is therefore allowable
to a king, provided he be a hero grim enough
and "earnest" enough, to kick men, cane them,
and run them through the body when he pleases;
and, after having sent a man to be tried by court-martial,
if the court acquits him, to order him to
be executed by his own despotic will. A truth-telling
Carlyle ought to have said, "I admit this
is murder; but I like the old fellow, and so I will
call it right." A Carlyle grown sophistical mumbles
something about its being like "the doings of
the gods," and leaves off with that small attempt
at humbug. Be brave, my men, and defend my
Lord Jeffreys next for bullying juries into hanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
prisoners. Was not Jeffreys "grim" too? In
fact, are not most murderers "grim"?</p>

<p>We have had occasion formerly, in this journal,
to examine the writings of another very positive
and clear-headed thinker,&mdash;Mr. Henry James.
Mr. James is, in his philosophy, the very antithesis
of Carlyle. With equal fervor of thought, with a
like vehemence of style, with a somewhat similar
contempt for his opponents, Mr. James takes exactly
the opposite view of religion and duty. As
Carlyle preaches the law, and the law alone, maintaining
justice as the sole Divine attribute, so Mr.
James preaches the Gospel only, denying totally
that to the Divine Mind any distinction exists between
saint and sinner, unless that the sinner is
somewhat more of a favorite than the saint. We
did not, do not, agree with Mr. James in his anti-nomianism;
as between him and Carlyle, we think
his doctrine far the truer and nobler. He stands
on a higher plane, and sees much the farther. A
course of reading in Mr. James's books might, we
think, help our English cynic not a little.</p>

<p>God is the perfect harmony of justice and love.
His justice is warmed through and through with
love, his love is sanctified and made strong by justice.
And so, in Christ, perfect justice was fulfilled
in perfect love. But in him first was fully
revealed, in this world, the Divine fatherly tenderness
to the lost, to the sinner, to those lowest down
and farthest away. In him was taught that our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
own redemption from evil does not lie in despising
and hating men worse than ourselves, but in saving
them. The hard Pharisaic justice of Carlyle
may call this "rose-water philanthropy," but till
he accepts it from his heart, and repents of his contempt
for his fallen fellowmen, till he learns to
love "scoundrels," there is no hope for him. He
lived once in the heaven of reverence, faith, and
love; he has gone from it into the hell of Pharisaic
scorn and contempt. Till he comes back out of
that, there is no hope for him.</p>

<p>But such a noble nature cannot be thus lost.
He will one day, let us trust, worship the divine
love which he now abhors. Cromwell asked, on
his death-bed, "if those once in a state of grace
could fall," and, being assured not, said, "I am
safe then, for I am sure I was once in a state of
grace." There is a truth in this doctrine of the
perseverance of saints. Some truths once fully
seen, even though afterward rejected by the mind
and will, stick like a barbed arrow in the conscience,
tormenting the soul till they are again
accepted and obeyed. Such a truth Carlyle once
saw, in the great doctrine of reverence for the
fallen and the sinful. He will see it again, if not
in this world, then in some other world.</p>

<p>The first Carlyle was an enthusiast, the last
Carlyle is a cynic. From enthusiasm to cynicism,
from the spirit of reverence to the spirit of contempt,
the way seems long, but the condition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
arriving is simple. Discard <span class="smcap">Love</span>, and the whole
road is passed over. Divorce love from truth, and
truth ceases to be open and receptive,&mdash;ceases to
be a positive function, turns into acrid criticism,
bitter disdain, cruel and hollow laughter, empty of
all inward peace. Such is the road which Carlyle
has passed over, from his earnest, hopeful youth to
his bitter old age.</p>

<p>Carlyle fulfilled for many, during these years,
the noble work of a mediator. By reverence and
love he saw what was divine in nature, in man,
and in life. By the profound sincerity of his
heart, his worship of reality, his hatred of falsehood,
he escaped from the commonplaces of literature
to a better land of insight and knowledge.
So he was enabled to lead many others out of their
entanglements, into his own luminous insight. It
was a great and blessed work. Would that it had
been sufficient for him!</p>

<h2 title="BUCKLE AND HIS THEORY OF AVERAGES"><a id="BUCKLE">BUCKLE AND HIS THEORY OF AVERAGES</a><a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></h2>

<p>We welcomed kindly the first installment of Mr.
Buckle's <span class="locked">work,<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span> giving a cursory account of it, and
hinting, rather than urging, the objections which
readily suggested themselves against theories concerning
Man, History, Civilization, and Human
Progress. But now it seems a proper time to discuss
with a little more deliberation the themes
opened before us by this intrepid writer,&mdash;this
latest champion of that theory of the mind which
in the last century was called Materialism and
Necessity, and which in the present has been re-baptized
as Positivism.</p>

<p>The doctrines of which Mr. Buckle is the ardent
advocate seem to us, the more thoroughly we consider
them, to be essentially theoretical, superficial,
and narrow. They are destitute of any broad
basis of reality. In their application by Mr.
Buckle, they fail to solve the historic problems
upon which he tries their power. With a show of
science, they are unscientific, being a mere collection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
of unverified hypotheses. And if Mr. Buckle
should succeed in introducing his principles and
methods into the study of history, it would be
equivalent to putting backward for about a century
this whole department of thought.</p>

<p>Yet, while we state this as our opinion, and one
which we shall presently endeavor to substantiate
by ample proof, we do not deny to Mr. Buckle's
volumes the interest arising from vigorous and
independent thinking, faithful study of details,
and a strong, believing purpose. They are interesting
and valuable contributions to our literature.
But this is not on account of their purpose, but
in spite of it; notwithstanding their doctrines, not
because of them. The interest of these books, as
of all good history, derives itself from their picturesque
reproduction of life. Whatever of value
belongs to Mr. Buckle's work is the same as that
of the writings of Macaulay, Motley, and Carlyle.
Whoever has the power of plunging like a diver
into the spirit of another period, sympathizing with
its tone, imbuing himself with its instincts, sharing
its loves and hates, its faith and its skepticism, will
write its history so as to interest us. For whoever
will really show to us the breathing essence of any
age, any state of society, or any course of human
events, cannot fail of exciting that element of the
soul which causes man everywhere to rejoice in
meeting with man. He who will write the history
of Arabians, Kelts, or Chinese, of the Middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
Ages, the Norman Sea-kings, or the Roman Plebs,
so that we can see ourselves beneath these diverse
surroundings of race, country, and period, and see
that these also are really <span class="smcap smaller">MEN</span>,&mdash;this writer instantly
awakens our interest, whether he call himself
poet, novelist, or historian. In all cases, the
secret of success is to write so as to enable the
reader to identify himself with the characters of
another age. Great authors enable us to look
at actions, not from without, but from within.
When we read the historic plays of Shakespeare,
or the historic novels of Scott, we are charmed by
finding that kings and queens are, after all, our
poor human fellow-creatures, sharing all our old,
familiar struggles, pains, and joys. When we read
that great historic masterpiece, the "French Revolution"
of Carlyle, the magic touch of the artist
introduces us into the heart of every character in
the motley, shifting scene. We are the poor king
escaping to Varennes under the dewy night and
solemn stars. We are tumultuous Mirabeau, with
his demonic but generous soul. We are devoted
Charlotte Corday; we are the Gironde; we the
poor prisoners of Terror, waiting in our prison for
the slow morning to bring the inevitable doom.
This is the one indispensable faculty for the historian;
and this faculty Mr. Buckle so far possesses
as to make his page a living one. It is true
that his sympathy is intellectual rather than imaginative.
It is not of the high order of Shakespeare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
nor even of that of Carlyle. But, so far as it goes,
it is a true faculty, and makes a true historian.</p>

<p>Yet we cannot but notice how the effectual
working of this historic organ is interfered with
by the dogmatic purpose of Mr. Buckle; and, on
the other hand, how his theoretic aim is disturbed
by the interest of his narrative. His history is
always meant to be an argument. His narrations
of events are never for their own sake, but always
to prove some thesis. There is, therefore, no consecutive
narrative, no progress of events, no sustained
interest. These volumes are episodes, put
together we cannot well say how, or why. In the
seventh chapter of the first volume we have a
graphic description of the Court life in England in
the days of Charles II., James II., William, and
the Georges, in connection with the condition of
the Church and clergy. From this we are taken,
in the next chapter, to France, and to similar relations
between Henry IV., Louis XIII., Richelieu,
and the French Catholics and Protestants. We
then are brought back to England, to consider the
protective system there; and once more we return
to France, to investigate its operation in that
country. Afterward we have an essay on "The
State of Historical Literature in France from the
End of the Sixteenth to the End of the Eighteenth
Century," followed by another essay on the "Proximate
Causes of the French Revolution." Many
very well finished biographic portraits are given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
us in these chapters. There are excellent sketches
of Burke, Voltaire, Richelieu, Bossuet, Montesquieu,
Rousseau, Bichat, in the first volume; and
of Adam Smith, Reid, Black, Leslie, Hutton,
Cullen, Hunter, in the second. These numerous
biographic sketches, which are often accompanied
with good literary notices of the writings of these
authors, are very ably written; but it is curious to
remember, while reading them, that Mr. Buckle
thinks that, as history advances, it has less and
less to do with biography.</p>

<p>There is an incurable defect in the method of
this work. On the one hand, the dogmatic purpose
is constantly breaking into the interest of the
narration; on the other, the interest of the narration
is continually enticing the writer from his
argument into endless episodes and details of biography.
The argument is deprived of its force by
the story; the story is interrupted continually on
account of the argument. Mr. Buckle has mistaken
the philosophy of history for history itself.
A history of civilization is not a piece of metaphysical
argument, but a consecutive account of the
social progress either of an age or of a nation.
This irreconcilable conflict of purpose, while it
leaves to the parts of the work their value, destroys
its worth as a whole.</p>

<p>Mr. Buckle might probably inquire whether we
would eliminate wholly from history all philosophic
aim, all teleologic purpose. He objects, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
very properly, to degrading history into mere annals,
without any instructive purpose. We agree
with him. We do not admire the style of history
which feels neither passion nor sympathy, which
narrates crimes without indignation, and which
has no aim in its narration except to entertain a
passing hour. But it is one thing deliberately to
announce a thesis and bring detached passages of
history to prove it, and another to write a history
which, by its incidents, spirit, and characters shall
convey impulse and instruction. The historian
may dwell upon the events which illustrate his
convictions, and may develop the argument during
the progress of his moving panorama; but the history
itself, as it moves, should impress the lesson.
The history of Mr. Motley, for example, illustrates
and impresses the evils of bigotry, superstition,
and persecution on the life of nations, quite
as powerfully as does that of Mr. Buckle; but
Mr. Motley never suspends his narrative in order
to prove to us logically that persecution is an evil.</p>

<p>Mr. Buckle, in his style of writing, belongs to a
modern class of authors whom we may call the
bullying school. It is true that he is far less extravagant
than some of them, and indeed is not
deeply tinged with their peculiar manner. The
first great master of this class of writers is Thomas
Carlyle; but their peculiarity has been carried to
its greatest extent by Ruskin. Its characteristic
feature is treating with supreme contempt, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
though they were hopeless imbeciles, all who venture
to question the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dicta</i> of the writer. This
superb arrogance makes these writers rather popular
with the English, who, as a nation, like equally
well to bully and to be bullied.</p>

<p>Buckle professes to have at last found the only
true key to history, and to have discovered some of
its important laws, especially those which regard
the progress of civilization.</p>

<p>I. <i>His View of Freedom.</i>&mdash;Mr. Buckle's fundamental
position is, that the actions of men are
governed by fixed laws, and that, when these laws
are discovered, history will become a science, like
geometry, geology, or astronomy. The chief obstacle
hitherto to its becoming a science has been
the belief that the actions of men were determined,
not by fixed laws, but by free will (which he considers
equivalent to chance), or by supernatural
interference or providence (which he regards as
equivalent to fate). "We shall thus be led," he
says (Vol. I. p. 6, Am. ed.), "to one vast question,
which, indeed, lies at the root of the whole subject,
and is simply this: Are the actions of men, and
therefore of societies, governed by fixed laws, or
are they the result either of chance or of supernatural
interference?" Identifying freedom with
chance, Mr. Buckle denies that there is such a
thing, and maintains that every human action is
determined by some antecedent, inward or outward,
and that not one is determined by the free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
choice of the man himself. His principal argument
against free will is the law of averages, which
we will therefore proceed to consider in its bearing
on this point.</p>

<p>Statistics, carefully collected during many years
and within different countries, show a regularity
of return in certain vices and crimes, which indicates
the presence of law. Thus, about the same
number of murders are committed every year in certain
countries and large cities, and even the instruments
by which they are committed are employed
in the same proportion. Suicide also follows some
regular law. "In a given state of society, a certain
number of persons must put an end to their
own life." In London, about two hundred and
forty persons kill themselves every year,&mdash;in
years of panic and disaster a few more, in prosperous
years not quite so many. Other actions of
men are determined in the same way,&mdash;not by
personal volition, but by some controlling circumstance.
"It is now known that the number of
marriages in England bears a fixed and definite
relation to the price of corn." "Aberrations of
memory are marked by this general character of
necessary and invariable order." The same average
number of persons forget every year to direct
the letters dropped into the post-offices of London
and Paris. Facts of this kind "force us to the
conclusion," says Buckle, "that the offenses of
men are the result, not so much of the vices of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
individual offender, as of the state of society into
which he is thrown."</p>

<p>The argument then is: If man's moral actions
are under law, they are not free, for freedom is
the absence of law. The argument of Mr. Buckle
is conclusive, provided freedom does necessarily
imply the absence of law. But such, we think, is
not the fact.</p>

<p>The actions of man do not proceed solely from
the impact of external circumstances; for then he
would be no better than a ball struck with a bat.
Nor do they proceed solely from the impulses of
his animal nature; for then he would be only a
superior kind of machine, moved by springs and
wheels. But in addition to external and internal
impulse there is also in man the power of personal
effort, activity, will,&mdash;to which we give the name
of Free Choice, or Freedom. This modifies and
determines a part of his actions,&mdash;while a second
part come from the influence of circumstance, and
a third from organic instincts and habitual tendencies.</p>

<p>Now, it is quite certain that no man has freedom
of will enough to cause <em>his whole</em> nexus of activity
to proceed from it. For if a man could cause <em>all</em>
his actions to proceed by a mere choice or effort,
he could turn himself at will into another man.
In other words, there could be no such thing as
permanent moral character. No one could be described;
for while we were describing him, he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
choose to be different, and so would become somebody
else. It is evident, therefore, that some part
of every man's life must lie outside of the domain
of freedom.</p>

<p>In what, then, does the essence of freedom consist?
If it be not the freedom to do whatever we
choose, what is it? Plainly, if we analyze our own
experience, we shall find that it is simply what its
scholastic name implies, freedom of choice, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">liber
arbitrio</i>. It is not, in the last analysis, freedom
to act, but it is freedom to choose.</p>

<p>But freedom to choose what? Can we choose
anything? Certainly not. Our freedom of choice
is limited by our knowledge. We cannot choose
that which we do not know. We must choose something
within the range of our experience. And our
freedom of choice consists in the alternative of making
this choice or omitting to make it,&mdash;exerting
ourselves or not exerting ourselves. Consciousness
testifies universally to this extent of freedom. We
know by our consciousness that we can exert ourselves
or not exert ourselves at any moment,&mdash;exert
ourselves to act or not exert ourselves to act,
to speak or not to speak. This power of making
or not making an effort is freedom in its simplest
and lowest form.</p>

<p>In this lowest form, it is apparent that human
freedom is inadequate to give any permanent character
to human actions. They will be directed by
the laws of organization and circumstance. Freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
in this sense may be compared to the power
which a man has of rowing a boat in the midst of
a fog. He may exert himself to row, he may row
at any moment forward or backward, to the right
or to the left. He has this freedom,&mdash;but it does
not enable him to go in any special direction. Not
being able to direct his boat to any fixed aim, it is
certain that it will be drifted by the currents or
blown by the winds. Freedom in this form is only
willfulness, because devoid of an inward law.</p>

<p>But let the will direct itself by a fixed law, and
it at once becomes true freedom, and begins to impress
itself upon actions, modifying the results of
organization and circumstance. Not even in this
case can it destroy those results; it only modifies
them. It enters as a third factor with those other
two to produce the product. The total character
of a man's actions will be represented by a formula,
thus: John's Organization <sub class="large">×</sub> John's Circumstances
<sub class="large">×</sub> John's Freedom = John's Character.</p>

<p>Apply this to the state of society where the law
of averages has been discovered. In such a society
there are always to be found three classes of persons.
In the first class, freedom is either dormant
or is mere willfulness. The law of mind is subject
therefore in these to the law of the members.
The will is an enslaved will, and its influence on
action is a nullity, not needing to be taken into
the account. From this class come the largest proportion
of the crimes and vices, regular in number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
because resulting from constant conditions of society.
Of these persons we can predict with certainty
that, under certain strong temptations to
evil, they will inevitably yield.</p>

<p>But in another class of persons the will has
learned to direct itself by a moral law toward a
fixed aim. The man in the boat is now steering
by a compass, and ceases to be the sport of current
and gale. The will reacts upon organization, and
directs circumstance. The man has learned how
to master his own nature, and how to arrange external
conditions. We can predict with certainty
that under no possible influences will this class
yield to some forms of evil.</p>

<p>There is also in each community a third class,
who are struggling, but not emancipated. They
are partly free, but not wholly so. From this class
come the slight variations of the average, now a
little better, now a little worse.</p>

<p>Applying this view of the freedom of the will to
history, we see that the problem is far more complicated
than Mr. Buckle admits. Man's freedom,
with him, is an element not to be taken into consideration,
because it does not exist. But the truth
is, that human freedom is not only a factor, but a
variable factor, the value of which changes with
every variety of human condition. In the savage
condition it obeys organization and circumstances,
and has little effect on social condition. But as
civilization advances, the power of freedom to react<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
on organization and circumstance increases, varying
however again, according to the force and inspiration
of the ideas by which it is guided. And
of all these ideas, precisely those which Mr. Buckle
underrates, namely, moral and religious ideas, are
those which most completely emancipate the will
from circumstances, and vitalize it with an all-conquering
force.</p>

<p>To see this, take two extreme cases,&mdash;that of an
African Hottentot, and that of Joan of Arc. Free
will in the African is powerless; he remains the
helpless child of his situation. But the Maid of
Arc, though utterly destitute of Mr. Buckle's "Intellectual
Truths" (being unable to read or write,
and having received no instruction save religious
ideas), and wanting in the "Skepticism" which he
thinks so essential to all historic progress, yet develops
a power of will which reacts upon circumstances
so as to turn into another channel the current
of French history. All bonds of situation
and circumstance are swept asunder by the power
of a will set free by mighty religious convictions.
The element of freedom, therefore, is one not to be
neglected by an historian, except to his own loss.</p>

<p>The law of averages applies only to undeveloped
men, or to the undeveloped sides of human nature,
where the element of freedom has not come in
play. When the human race shall have made
such progress that it shall contain a city inhabited
by a million persons all equal to the Apostle Paul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
and the Apostle John in spiritual development, it
will not be found that a certain regular number
kill their wives every year, or that from two hundred
and thirteen to two hundred and forty annually
commit suicide. Nor will this escape from
the averages be owing to an increased acquaintance
with physical laws so much as to a higher moral
development. We shall return to this point, however,
when we examine more fully Buckle's doctrine
in regard to the small influence of religion
on civilization.</p>

<p>II. <i>Mr. Buckle's View of Organization.</i>&mdash;Mr.
Buckle sets aside entirely the whole great fact of
organization, upon which the science of ethnology
is based. Perhaps the narrowness of his mind
shows more conspicuously in this than elsewhere.
He attributes no influence to race in civilization.
While so many eminent writers at the present day
say, with Mr. Knox, that "Race is everything,"
Mr. Buckle quietly rejoins that Race is nothing.
"Original distinctions of race," he says, "are altogether
hypothetical." "We have no decisive
ground for saying that the moral and intellectual
faculties in man are likely to be greater in an infant
born in the most civilized part of Europe,
than in one born in the wildest region of a barbarous
country." (Vol. I. p. 127, Am. ed.) "We
often hear of hereditary talents, hereditary vices,
and hereditary virtues; but whoever will critically
examine the evidence will find that we have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
proof of their existence." He doubts the existence
of hereditary insanity, or a hereditary tendency to
suicide, or even to disease. (Vol. I. p. 128, note.)
He does not believe in any progress of natural
capacity in man, but only of opportunity, "that is,
an improvement in the circumstances under which
that capacity after birth comes into play." "Here
then is the gist of the whole matter. The progress
is one, not of internal power, but of external advantage."
He goes on to say, in so many words,
that the only difference between a barbarian child
and a civilized child is in the pressure of surrounding
circumstances. In support of these opinions
he quotes Locke and Turgot.</p>

<p>It is difficult to understand how an intelligent
and well-informed man, an immense reader and
active thinker, can have lived in the midst of the
nineteenth century and retain these views. For
students at every extreme of thought have equally
recognized the force of organization, the constancy
of race, the permanent varieties existing in the human
family, the steady ruling of the laws of descent.
If there is any one part of the science of anthropology
in which the nineteenth century has reversed
the judgment of the eighteenth,&mdash;and that equally
among men of science, poets, materialists, idealists,
anatomists, philologists,&mdash;it is just here. To find
so intelligent a man reproducing the last century
in the midst of the present is a little extraordinary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
Perhaps there could not be found four great
thinkers more different in their tendencies of
thought and range of study than Goethe, Spurzheim,
Dr. Prichard, and Max Müller; yet these
four, each by his own method of observation, have
shown with conclusive force the law of variety and
of permanence in organization. Goethe asserts
that every individual man carries from his birth to
his grave an unalterable speciality of being,&mdash;that
he is, down to the smallest fibre of his character,
one and the same man; and that the whole
mighty power of circumstance, modifying everything,
cannot abolish anything,&mdash;that organization
and circumstance hold on together with an
equally permanent influence in every human life.
Gall and Spurzheim teach that every fibre of the
brain has its original quality and force, and that
such qualities and forces are transmitted by obscure
but certain laws of descent. Prichard, with
immense learning, describes race after race, giving
the types of each human family in its physiology.
And, finally, the great science of comparative philology,
worked out by such thinkers and students as
Bopp, Latham, Humboldt, Bunsen, Max Müller,
and a host of others, has proved the permanence
of human varieties by ample glossological evidence.
Thus the modern science of ethnology has arisen,
on the basis of physiology, philology, and ethology,
and is perhaps the chief discovery of the age.
Yet Mr. Buckle quietly ignores the whole of it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
and continues, with Locke, to regard every human
mind as a piece of white paper, to be written on
by external events,&mdash;a piece of soft putty, to be
moulded by circumstances.</p>

<p>The facts on which the science of ethnology
rests are so numerous and so striking, that the
only difficulty in selecting an illustration is from
the quantity and richness of material. But we
may take two instances,&mdash;that of the Teutons and
Kelts, to show the permanence of differences under
the same circumstances, and that of the Jews, the
Arabs, and the Gypsies, to show the continuity of
identity under different circumstances. For if it
can be made evident that different races of men
preserve different characters, though living for
long periods under similar circumstances, and that
the same race preserves the same character, though
living for long periods under different circumstances,
the proof is conclusive that character is
<em>not</em> derived from circumstances only. We shall
not indeed go to the extreme of such ethnologists
as Knox, Nott, or Gliddon, and say that "Race is
everything, and circumstances nothing," but we
shall see that Mr. Buckle is mistaken in saying
that "Circumstances are everything, and race nothing."</p>

<p>The differences of character between the German
and Keltic varieties of the human race are
marked, but not extreme. They both belong to
the same great Indo-European or Aryan family.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
They both originated in Asia, and the German
emigration seems to have followed immediately
after that of the Kelts. Yet when described by
Cæsar, Tacitus, and Strabo, they differed from
each other exactly as they differ now. They have
lived for some two thousand years in the same
climate, under similar political and social institutions,
and yet they have preserved their original
diversity.</p>

<p>According to the description of Cæsar<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> and
<span class="locked">Tacitus<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span> the German tribes differed essentially
from the Gauls or Kelts in the following particulars.
The Germans loved freedom, and were all
free. The Kelts did not care for freedom. The
meanest German was free. But all the inferior
people among the Kelts were virtually slaves.
The Germans had no priests, and did not care for
sacrifices. The Kelts had a powerful priesthood
and imposing religious rites. The Germans were
remarkable for their blue eyes, light hair, and
large limbs. The Kelts were dark-complexioned.
The Gauls were more quick, but less persevering,
than the Germans. Ready to attack, they were
soon discouraged. Tacitus, describing the Germans,
says: "They are a pure, unmixed, and
independent race; there is a family likeness
through the nation, the same form and features,
stern blue eyes, ruddy hair; a strong sense of
honor; reverence for women; religious, but without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
a ritual; superstitiously believing in supernatural
signs and portents, but not in a priesthood;
not living in cities, but in scattered homes; respecting
marriage; the children brought up in the
dirt, among the cattle; hospitable, frank, and
generous; fond of drinking beer, and eating preparations
of milk."</p>

<p>The German and Keltic races, thus distinguished
in the days of Cæsar, are equally distinct to-day.
Catholicism, the religion of a priesthood, a ritual,
and authority, prevails among the Kelts; Protestantism
among the Germans. Ireland, being mainly
Keltic, is Catholic, though a part of a Protestant
nation. France, being mainly Keltic, is also
Catholic, in spite of all its illumination, its science,
and its knowledge of "intellectual laws."
But as France contains a large infusion of German
(Frankish) blood, it is the most Protestant of
Catholic nations; while Scotland, containing the
largest infusion of Keltic blood, is the most priest-ridden
of Protestant nations. This last fact, which
Mr. Buckle asserts, and spends half a volume in
trying to account for, is explained at once by
ethnology. Wherever the Germans go to-day,
they remain the same people they were in the days
of Tacitus; they carry the same blue eyes and
light hair, the same love of freedom and hatred
of slavery, the same tendencies to individualism in
thought and life, the same tendency to superstitious
belief in supernatural events, even when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
without belief in any religion or church; and even
the same love for beer, and "lac concretum," now
called "schmeercase" in our Western settlements.
The Kelt, also, everywhere continues the same.
He loves equality more than freedom. He is a
democrat, but not an abolitionist. Very social,
clannish, with more wit than logic, very sensitive
to praise, brave, but not determined, needing a
leader, he carries the spirit of the Catholic Church
into Protestantism, and the spirit of despotism
into free institutions. And that physical, no less
than mental qualities, continue under all climates
and institutions is illustrated by the blue eyes and
light hair which the traveller meets among the
Genoese and Florentines, reminding him of their
Lombard ancestors; while their superior tendencies
to freedom in church and state suggest the
same origin.</p>

<p>Nineteen hundred years have passed since Julius
Cæsar pointed out these diversities of character
then existing between the Germans and Kelts.
Since then they have passed from barbarism to
civilization. Instead of living in forests, as hunters
and herdsmen, they have built cities, engaged
in commerce, manufactures, and agriculture. They
have been converted to Christianity, have conquered
the Roman empire, engaged in crusades,
fought in a hundred different wars, developed
literatures, arts, and sciences, changed and changed
again their forms of government, have been organized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
by Feudalism, by Despotism, by Democracy,
have gone through the Protestant reformation,
have emigrated to all countries and climates;
and yet, at the end of this long period, the German
everywhere remains a German, and the Kelt
a Kelt. The descriptions of Tacitus and Cæsar
still describe them accurately. And yet Mr.
Buckle undertakes to write a history of civilization
without taking the element of race into account.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, the power of this element of
race is illustrated still more strikingly in the case
of the wandering and dispersed families, who,
having ceased to be a nation, continue in their
dispersions to manifest the permanent type of their
original and ineffaceable organization. Wherever
the Jew goes, he remains a Jew. In all
climates, under all governments, speaking all languages,
his physical and mental features continue
the same. This amazing fact has been held by
many theologians to be a standing miracle of
Divine Providence. But Providence works by
law, and through second causes, and uses in this
instance the laws of a specially stubborn organization
and the force of a tenacious and persistent
blood to accomplish its ends. The same kind of
blood in the kindred Semitic family of Arabs produces
a like result, though to a less striking degree.
The Bedouins wander for thousands of miles away
from their peninsula, but always continue Arabs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
in appearance and character. The light, sinewy
body and brilliant dark eye, the abstemious habit
and roaming tendency, mark the Arab in Hindostan
or Barbary. It is a thousand years since
these nomad tribes left their native home, but
they continue the same people on the Persian Gulf
or amid the deserts of Sahara.</p>

<p>The case of the Gypsies, however, may be still
more striking, because these seem, in their wanderings
over the earth, to have gradually divested
themselves of every other common attribute except
that of race. Unlike the Jews and Arabs,
they not only adopt the language, but also the
religion, of the country where they happen to be.
Yet they always remain unfused and unassimilated.</p>

<p>The Gypsies first appeared in Europe in 1417,
in Moldavia, and thence spread into Transylvania
and <span class="locked">Hungary.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span> They afterward passed into all
the countries of Europe, where their number, at
the present time, is supposed to reach 700,000 or
800,000. Everywhere they adopt the common
form of worship, but are without any real faith.
Partially civilized in some countries, they always
retain their own language beside that of the people
among whom they live. This language, being evidently
derived from the Sanskrit, settles the question
of their origin. It is common to all their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
branches through the world; as are also the sweet
voice of their maidens, and their habits of horse-dealing,
fortune-telling, and petty larceny. Without
the bond of religion, history, government,
literature, or mutual knowledge and intercourse,
they still remain one and the same people in all
their dispersions. What gives this unity and permanence,
if not race? Yet race, to Mr. Buckle,
means nothing.</p>

<p>III. <i>Mr. Buckle's Theory concerning Skepticism.</i>&mdash;One
of the laws of history which Mr.
Buckle considers himself to have established, if
not discovered, is that a spirit of skepticism precedes
necessarily the progress of knowledge, and
therefore of civilization. By skepticism he means
a doubt of the truth of received opinions. He
asserts that "a spirit of doubt" is the necessary
antecedent to "the love of inquiry." (Vol. I. p.
242, Am. ed.) "Doubt must intervene before
investigation can begin. Here, then, we have the
act of doubting as the originator, or at all events
the necessary antecedent, of all progress."</p>

<p>If this were so, progress would be impossible.
For the great groundwork of knowledge for each
generation must be laid in the minds of children;
and children learn, not by doubting, but by believing.
Children are actuated at the same time
by an insatiable curiosity and an unquestioning
faith. They ask the reason of everything, and
they accept every reason which is given them. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
they stopped to question and to doubt, they would
learn very little. But by not doubting at all,
while they are made to believe some errors, they
acquire an immense amount of information. Kind
Mother Nature understands the process of learning
and the principle of progress much better than
Mr. Buckle, and fortunately supplies every new
generation of children with an ardent desire for
knowledge, and a disposition to believe everything
they hear.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, Mr. Buckle refers to men
rather than children. He may not insist on children's
stopping to question everything they hear
before they believe. But in men perhaps this
spirit is essential to progress. What great skeptics,
then, have been also great discoverers? Which
was the greatest discoverer, Leibnitz or Bayle,
Sir Isaac Newton or Voltaire? A faith amounting
nearly to credulity is almost essential to discovery,&mdash;a
faith which foresees what it cannot
prove, which follows suggestions and hints, and so
traces the faintest impressions left by the flying
footsteps of truth. The attitude of the intellect
in all discovery is not that of doubt, but of faith.
The discoverer always appears to critical and skeptical
men as a visionary.</p>

<p>"To skepticism," says Mr. Buckle, "we owe the
spirit of inquiry, which, during the last two centuries,
has gradually encroached on every possible
subject, and reformed every department of practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
and speculative knowledge." But this is
plainly what logicians call a ὕστερον πρότερον {hysteron proteron}, or
what common people call "putting the cart before
the horse." It is not skepticism which produces
the spirit of inquiry, but the spirit of inquiry
which produces skepticism. It was not a doubt
concerning the Mosaic cosmogony which led to the
study of geology; the study of geology led to the
doubt of the cosmogony. Skepticism concerning
the authority of the Church did not lead to the
discovery of the Copernican system; the discovery
of the Copernican system led to doubts concerning
the authority of the Church which denied it.
People do not begin by doubting, but by seeking.
The love of knowledge leads them to inquire, and
inquiry shows to them new truths. The new
truths, being found to be opposed to received opinions,
cause a doubt concerning those opinions to
arise in the mind. Skepticism, therefore, may
easily follow, but does not precede inquiry.</p>

<p>Skepticism, being a negative principle, is necessarily
unproductive and barren. To have no
strong belief, no fixed opinion, no vital conviction
for or against anything,&mdash;this is surely not a state
of intellect favorable to any great creation or discovery.
Goethe, who was certainly no bigot, says, in
a volume of his posthumous works, that skepticism
is only an inverted superstition, and that this skepticism
is one of the chief evils of the present age.
"It is worse," he adds, "than superstition, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
superstition is the inheritance of energetic, heroic,
progressive natures; skepticism belongs to weak,
contracted, shrinking men, who venture not out of
themselves." Lord Bacon says ("Advancement of
Learning," Book II.) that doubts have their advantages
in learning, of which he mentions two, but
says that "both these commodities do scarcely
countervail an inconvenience which will intrude
itself, if it be not debarred; which is, that when a
doubt is once received, men labor rather how to
keep it a doubt than how to solve it." It will be
seen, therefore, that Lord Bacon gives to skepticism
scarcely more encouragement than is given it
by Goethe.</p>

<p>Mr. Buckle says (Vol. I. p. 250) that "Skepticism,
which in physics must always be the beginning
of science, in religion must always be the
beginning of toleration." We have seen that in
physics skepticism is rather the end of science than
its beginning, and the same is true of toleration.
Skepticism does not necessarily produce toleration.
The Roman augurs, who laughed in each other's
faces, were quite ready to assist at the spectacle of
Christians thrown to the lions. Skeptics, not having
any inward conviction as a support, rest on
established opinions, and are angry at seeing them
disturbed. A strong belief is sufficient for itself,
but a half-belief wishes to put down all doubts by
force. This is well expressed by Thomas Burnet
(Epistola 2, De Arch. Phil.): "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Non potui non in<span class="pagenum" xml:lang="en" lang="en"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
illam semper propendere opinionem, Neminem
irasci in veritate defendenda, qui eandem plene
possidet, viditque in claro lumine. Evidens enim,
et indubitata ratio, sibi sufficit et acquiescit: aliisque
a scopo oberrantibus, non tam succenset, quam
miseretur. Sed cum argumentorum adversantium
aculeos sentimus, et quodammodo periclitari causam
nostram, tum demum æstuamus, et effervescimus.</span>"</p>

<p>The least firm believers have often been the
most violent persecutors. Nero persecuted the
Christians; Marcus Antoninus persecuted them;
but neither Nero nor Antoninus had any religious
reason for this persecution. Antoninus, the best
head of his time, was a sufficient skeptic to suit
Mr. Buckle, as regards all points of the established
religion, but his skepticism did not prevent
him from being a persecutor. Unbelieving Popes,
like Alexander VI. and Leo X., have persecuted.
True toleration is not born of unbelief, as Mr.
Buckle supposes, but of a deeper faith. Religious
liberty has not been given to the world by skeptics,
but by such men as Milton, Baxter, Jeremy Taylor,
and Roger Williams.</p>

<p>So far from general skepticism being the antecedent
condition of intellectual progress and discovery,
it is a sign of approaching intellectual stagnation
and decay. A great religious movement
usually precedes and prepares the way for a great
mental development. Thus the religious activity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
born of Protestantism showed its results in England
in the age of Elizabeth, and in a general outbreak
of intellectual activity over all Europe. On
the other hand, the skepticism of the eighteenth
century was accompanied by comparative stagnation
of thought throughout Christendom.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Mr. Buckle's View of the small Influence of
Religion on Civilization.</i>&mdash;Mr. Buckle thinks it
is erroneous to suppose that religion is one of the
prime movers of human affairs. (Vol. I. p. 183.)
Religion, according to him, has little to do with
human progress. In this opinion, he differs from
nearly all other great historians and philosophical
thinkers. In modern times, Hegel, Niebuhr, Guizot,
Arnold, and Macaulay, among others, have
discussed the part taken by religious ideas in the development
of man, laying the greatest stress on this
element. But Mr. Buckle denies that religion is
one of the prime movers in human affairs. The
Crusades have been thought to have exercised
some influence on European civilization. But religion
was certainly the prime mover of the Crusades.
Mohammedanism exercised some influence on the
development of European life. But Mohammedanism
was an embodiment of religious ideas.
The Protestant Reformation shook every institution,
every nation, every part of social life, in
Christendom, and Europe rocked to its foundations
under the influence of this great movement. But
religion was the prime mover of it all. The English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
Revolution turned on religious ideas. The
rise of the Dutch Republic was determined by
them. In one form they colonized South America
and Mexico; in another form, they planted New
England. Such great constructive minds as those
of Alfred and Charlemagne have been benevolently
inspired by rational religion; such dark, destructive
natures as those of Philip II. of Spain, Catharine
de Medicis of France, and Mary Tudor of
England have been malevolently inspired by fanatical
religion.</p>

<p>On what grounds, then, does Mr. Buckle dispute
the influence of religion? On two grounds
mainly. First, he tells us that moral ideas are
not susceptible of progress, and therefore cannot
have exercised any perceptible influence on the
progress of civilization. For that which does not
change, he argues, cannot influence that which
changes. That which has been known for thousands
of years cannot be the cause of an event
which took place for the first time only yesterday.
"Since civilization is the product of moral and
intellectual agencies," says Mr. Buckle, "and since
that product is constantly changing, it cannot be
regulated by the stationary agent; because when
surrounding circumstances are unchanged, a stationary
agent can produce only a stationary effect."
On this principle, gravitation could not be the
cause of the appearance of Donati's comet in the
neighborhood of the sun. For gravitation is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
stationary and uniform agent; it cannot therefore
produce an accelerated motion. Mr. Buckle will
answer, that though the law of gravitation is one
and the same in all ages, and uniform in its action,
the result of its action may be different at different
times, according to the position in the universe of
the object acted upon. True; and in like manner
we may say, that, though religious ideas are immutable,
the result of their action on the human mind
may be different, according to the position of that
mind in relation to them. The doctrine of one
God, the Maker and Lord of all things, was not a
new one, or one newly discovered in the seventh
century. Yet when applied by Mohammed to the
Arabian mind, it was like a spark coming in contact
with gunpowder. Those wandering sons of
the desert, unknown before in the affairs of the
world, and a negative quantity in human history,
sprang up a terrible power, capable of overrunning
and conquering half the earth. Religion awakened
them; religion organized them; religion directed
them. The fact that an idea is an old one is no
proof, therefore, that it may not suddenly begin to
act with awful efficiency on civilization and the
destiny of man.</p>

<p>The other reason given by Mr. Buckle why religious
ideas have little influence in history is, that
the religion of a nation is symptomatic of its mental
and moral state. Men take the religious ideas
which suit them. A religion not suited to a people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
cannot be accepted by it; or, if accepted, has no
influence on it. This thought, argued at considerable
length by Mr. Buckle, is so perfectly true as
to be a truism. The religion of a people is no
doubt an effect. But may it not also be a cause?
It, no doubt, cannot be received by a people not
prepared for it. But does it therefore exercise no
influence on a people which it finds prepared?
Fire cannot explode an unexplosive material, nor
inflame one not inflammable. But does it follow
that it effects nothing when brought into contact
with one which is inflammable or explosive? A
burning coal laid on a rock or put into the water
produces no effect. But does this prove that the
explosion of gunpowder is in no manner due to the
contact of fire?</p>

<p>"The religion of mankind," says Mr. Buckle,
"is the effect of their improvement, and not the
cause of it." His proof is that missions and missionaries
among the heathen produce only a superficial
change among barbarous and unenlightened
tribes. Knowledge, he says, must prepare the
way for it. There must, no doubt, be some kind
of preparation for Christianity. But does it follow
that Christianity, when its way is prepared, is
<em>only</em> an effect? Why may it not be also a cause?
Judaism prepared the way for Christianity. But
did not Christianity produce some effect on Judaism?
The Arab mind was prepared for Mohammedanism.
But did not Mohammedanism produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
some effect on the Arab mind? Europe was prepared
by various influences for Protestantism.
But did not Protestantism produce some effects on
Europe?</p>

<p>It might, with equal truth, and perhaps with
greater truth, be asserted that intellectual ideas
are the result of previous training, and that they
are therefore an effect, and by no means a cause.
The intellectual truths accepted by any period depend
certainly on the advanced condition of human
culture. You cannot teach logarithms to Hottentots,
trigonometry to Digger Indians, or the differential
calculus to the Feejee Islanders. Hence,
according to our author's logic, those very intellectual
ideas which he thinks the only great movers
in human affairs are really no movers at all, but
only symptoms of the actual intellectual condition
of a nation.</p>

<p>But it is a curious fact, that, while Mr. Buckle
considers religious ideas of so little importance in
the history of civilization, he nevertheless devotes
a large part of both his volumes to proving the
great evil done to civilization by erroneous forms
of religious opinion. Nearly the whole of his second
volume is in fact given to showing the harm
done in Spain and Scotland by false systems of
religious thought. Why spend page after page
in showing the evil influence of false religion on
society, if religion, whether true or false, has
scarcely any influence at all? Why search through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
all the records of religious fanaticism and superstition,
to bring up to the day the ghosts of dead beliefs,
if these beliefs are, after all, powerless either
for good or evil?</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The second volume, the recent publication of
which has suggested this second review of Mr.
Buckle's work, contains much of interest and
value, but suffers from the imperfect method of
which we complained at the beginning of this article.
It is chiefly devoted to a description of the
evils resulting from priestcraft in the two countries
of Spain and Scotland. It contains six chapters.
The first is on the History of the Spanish Intellect
from the fifth to the middle of the nineteenth
century. The other five chapters relate to Scotland.</p>

<p>In the chapter on Spain Buckle attempts to show
how loyalty and superstition began in this nation,
and what has been the result. Of course, according
to his theory, he is obliged to trace their origin
to external circumstances, and he finds the cause
of the superstition in the climate, which produced
drought and famine, and in the earthquakes which
alarmed the people. And here Mr. Buckle, following
the philosophy of Lucretius, confounds religion
and fear, and puts the occasion for the cause. But,
beside earthquakes, the Arian heresy helped to
create this superstition, by identifying the wars
for national independence with those for religion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
and so giving a great ascendency to the priests.
Hence the Church in Spain early acquired great
power, and, naturally allying itself with the government,
gave rise to the sentiment of loyalty, which
was increased by the Moorish invasion and the
long wars which followed. Loyalty and superstition
thus became so deeply rooted in the Spanish
mind, that they could not be eradicated by the
efforts of the government. Nothing but knowledge
can cure this blind and servile loyalty and
this abject superstition, and while Spain continues
sunk in ignorance it must always remain superstitious
and submissive.</p>

<p>Some difficulties, however, suggest themselves
in the way of this very simple explanation. If
superstitious loyalty to Church and king comes
from earthquakes, why are not the earthquake
regions of the West Indies and of South America
more loyal, instead of being in a state of chronic
revolution? And how came Scotland to be so
diseased with loyalty and superstition, when she
is so free from earthquakes? And if knowledge
is such a certain cure for superstition, why was not
Spain cured by the flood of light which she, alone
of all European countries, enjoyed in the Middle
Ages? Spain was for a long time the source of
science and art to all Europe, whose Christian
sons resorted to her universities and libraries for
instruction. There was taught to English, French,
and German students the philosophy of Aristotle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
the Græco-Arabic literature, mathematics, and natural
history. The numerals, gunpowder, paper,
and other inventions of the Arabs, passed into
Europe from Spain. She possessed, therefore,
that knowledge of physical laws which Mr. Buckle
declares to be the only cure for superstition. Yet
she was not cured. The nation which, according
to his theory, ought to have been soonest delivered
from superstition, according to his statements has
retained its yoke longer than any other.</p>

<p>From Spain Mr. Buckle passes to Scotland,
where he finds a still more complicated problem.
Superstition and loyalty ought to go together, he
thinks,&mdash;and usually do; but in Scotland they are
divorced. The Scotch have always been superstitious,
but disloyal. To the explanation of this fact
Mr. Buckle bends his energies of thought, and of
course is able to find a theory to account for it.
This theory we shall not stop to detail; it is too
complex, and at the same time too superficial, to
dwell upon. Its chief point is that the Protestant
noblemen and Protestant clergy quarreled about
the wealth of the Catholic Church, and so there
was in Scotland a complete rupture between the
two classes elsewhere in alliance. Thus "the
clergy, finding themselves despised by the governing
class, united themselves heartily with the people,
and advocated democratic principles." Such
is the explanation given to the course of history in
a great nation. A quarrel between its noblemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
and its ministers (who are of course represented as
mercenary self-seekers) determines its permanent
character!</p>

<p>Mr. Buckle, to whom the love of plunder appears
as the cause of what other men regard as loyalty
or religion, explains by the same fact the loyalty of
the Highlanders to King Charles. They thought
that, if he conquered, he would allow them to plunder
the Lowlanders once more. This is Buckle's
explanation. An ethnologist would have remembered
the fact that the Gaels are pure-blooded
Kelts, and that the Kelts <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pur sang</i> are everywhere
distinguished for loyalty to their chiefs.</p>

<p>Mr. Buckle encounters another difficulty in
Scottish history in this, that though a new and
splendid literature arose in Scotland at the beginning
of the eighteenth century, it was unable to
diminish national superstition. It was thoroughly
skeptical, and yet did not produce the appropriate
effect of skepticism. So that at this point one of Mr.
Buckle's four great laws of history seems to break
down. For a moment he appears discouraged,
and laments, with real pathos, the limitations of
the human intellect. But in the next chapter he
addresses himself again to the solution of his two-fold
problem, viz.: "1st, that the same people
should be liberal in their politics and illiberal in
their religion; and, 2d, that their free and skeptical
literature in the eighteenth century should
have been unable to lessen their religious illiberality."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
In approaching this part of his task, in the fifth
chapter, our author gives a very elaborate and
highly colored picture of the religion of Scotland.
It is <em>too</em> well done. Like some of Macaulay's
descriptions, it is so very striking as to impress us
almost inevitably as a caricature. Every statement
in which the horrors and cruelties of Calvinism
are described is indeed reinforced by ample
citations or plentiful references in the footnotes.
But some of these seem capable of a different
inference from that drawn in the text. For instance,
he charges the Scottish clergy with teaching,
that, though the arrangements originally
made by the Deity to punish his creatures were
ample, "they were insufficient; and hell, not
being big enough to contain the countless victims
incessantly poured into it, had in these latter days
been enlarged. There was now sufficient room."
He supports the charge by this reference to Abernethy,&mdash;"Hell
has enlarged itself,"&mdash;apparently
not being aware that Abernethy was merely quoting
from Isaiah. He says that to write poetry
was considered by the Scotch clergy to be a grievous
offence, and worthy of special condemnation.
He supports his statement by this reference: "A
mastership in a grammar school was offered in
1767 to John Wilson, the author of 'Clyde'" (a
poet, by the by, not found among the twenty John
Wilsons commemorated by Watt). "But, says
his biographer, the magistrates and ministers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Greenock thought fit, before they would admit
Mr. Wilson to the superintendence of the grammar
school, to stipulate that he should abandon
'the profane and unprofitable art of poem-making.'"
This fact, however, by no means proves
that poetry was considered, theologically, a sin,
for perhaps it was regarded practically as only a
disqualification. It is to be feared that many of
our school committees now&mdash;country shopkeepers,
perhaps, or city aldermen&mdash;would, apart from
Calvinism, think that a poet must be necessarily a
dreamer and an unpractical man.</p>

<p>A few exaggerations of this kind there may be.
But, on the whole, the account seems to be correctly
given; and it is one which will do good.</p>

<p>In the remaining portion of the second volume
Mr. Buckle gives a very vigorous description of
the intellectual progress of the Scotch during the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. His account
of Adam Smith as a writer is peculiarly
brilliant. His views of Hume and Reid are ably
drawn. Thence he proceeds to discuss the discoveries
of Black and Leslie in natural philosophy,
of Smith and Hutton in geology, of Cavendish in
chemistry, of Cullen and Hunter in physiology
and pathology. These discussions are interesting,
and show a great range of knowledge and power
of study in the writer. Yet they are episodes, and
have little bearing on the main course of his
thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
We have thus given a cursory survey of these
volumes. We do not think Buckle's philosophy
sound, his method good, or his doctrines tenable.
Yet we cannot but sympathize with one who has
devoted his strength and youth with such untiring
industry to such a great enterprise. And we must
needs be touched with the plaintive confession
which breaks from his wearied mind and exhausted
hope in the last volume, when he accepts the defeat
of his early endeavor, and submits to the
disappointment of his youthful hope. We should
be glad to quote the entire <span class="locked">passage,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span> because it is
the best in the book, and because he expresses in
it, in the most condensed form, his ideas and purposes
as an historic writer. But our limited space
allows us only to commend it to the special attention
of the reader.</p>

<p class="in0">No such interest attaches to the "Life of Voltaire."
His most serious adventure was being shut up in
the Bastille for a pasquinade, and being set free
again on his solemn protestation, true or false,
that he never wrote it. It is an old story, told a
thousand times, with all its gloss, if it ever had any,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
quite worn off. The "Life of Franklin," which,
on the whole, we think the best of Parton's biographies,
was full of interest and instruction of another
kind. It was the life of a builder,&mdash;of one
who gave his great powers to construction, to
building up new institutions and new sciences, to
the discovery of knowledge and the creation of
national life. Voltaire was a diffuser of knowledge
already found, but he had not the patience
nor the devotion of a discoverer. His gift was
not to construct good institutions, but to destroy
bad ones,&mdash;a work the interest of which is necessarily
ephemeral. No wonder, therefore, that Mr.
Parton, with all his practiced skill as a biographer,
has not been able to give to the story of Voltaire
the thrilling interest which he imparted to that of
Franklin and of Jackson.</p>

<p>We gladly take the present opportunity to add
our recognition of Mr. Parton's services to those
which have come to him from other quarters. A
writer of unequal merit, and one whose judgment
is often biased by his prejudices, he nevertheless
has done much to show how biography should be
written. Of all forms of human writing there is
none which ought to be at once so instructive and
so interesting as this, but in the large majority of
instances it is the most vapid and empty. The
good biographies, in all languages, are so few that
they can almost be counted on the fingers; but
these are among the most precious books in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
literature of mankind. The story of Ruth, the
Odyssey of Homer, Plutarch's lives, the Memorabilia
of Xenophon, the life of Agricola, the Confessions
of Augustine, among the ancients; and, in
modern times, Boswell's "Johnson," the autobiographies
of Alfieri, Benvenuto Cellini, Franklin,
Goethe, Voltaire's "Charles XII.," and Southey's
"Life of Wesley" are specimens of what may
be accomplished in this direction. It has been
thought that any man can write a biography, but
it requires genius to understand genius. How
much intelligence is necessary to collect with discrimination
the significant facts of a human life;
to penetrate to the law of which they are the expression;
to give the picturesque proportions to
every part, to arrange the foreground, the middle
distance, and the background of the panorama; to
bring out in proper light and shadow the features
and deeds of the hero! Few biographers take
this trouble. They content themselves with collecting
the letters written by and to their subject;
sweeping together the facts of his life, important
or otherwise; arranging them in some kind of
chronological order; and then having this printed
and bound up in one or two heavy volumes.</p>

<p>To all this many writers of biography add another
fault, which is almost a fatal one. They
treat their subject <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">de haut en bas</i>, preferring to
look down upon him rather than to look up to
him. They occupy themselves in criticising his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
faults and pointing out his deficiencies, till they
forget to mention what he has accomplished to
make him worthy of having his life written at all.
We lately saw a life of Pope treated in this style.
One unacquainted with Pope, after reading it,
would say, "If he was such a contemptible fellow,
and his writings so insignificant, why should we
have to read his biography?" Thomas Carlyle
has the great merit of leading the way in the
opposite direction, and of thus initiating a new
style of biography. The old method was for the
writer to regard himself as a judge on the bench,
and the subject of his biography as a prisoner at
the bar. Carlyle, in his "Life of Schiller," showed
himself a loving disciple, sitting at the feet of his
master. We recollect that when this work first
appeared there were only a few copies known to be
in this country. One was in the possession of an
eminent professor in Harvard College, of whom
the present writer borrowed it. On returning it,
he was asked what he thought of it, and replied
that he considered it written with much enthusiasm.
"Yes," responded the professor, "I myself
thought it rather extravagant." Enthusiasm in a
biographer was then considered to be the same as
extravagance. But this hero-worship, which is
the charm in Plutarch, Xenophon, and Boswell,
inspired a like interest in Carlyle's portraits of
Schiller, Goethe, Richter, Burns, and the actors in
the French Revolution. So true is his own warning:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
"Friend, if you wish me to take an interest
in what you say, be so kind as to take some interest
in it yourself"&mdash;a golden maxim, to be
kept in mind by all historians, writers of travels,
biographers, preachers, and teachers. A social
success may sometimes be accomplished by assuming
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">blasé</i> air of the Roman emperor who said,
"Omnia fui, nihil expedit;" but this tone is
ruinous for one who wishes the ear of the public.</p>

<p>Since the days of Carlyle, others have written
in the same spirit, allowing themselves to take
more or less interest in the man whose life they
were relating. So Macaulay, in his sketches of
Clive, Hastings, Chatham, Pym, and Hampden;
so Lewes, in his "Life of Goethe;" and so Parton,
in his various biographies.</p>

<p>In some respects Mr. Parton's biography reminds
us of Macaulay's History. Both have been
credited with the same qualities, both charged
with the same defects. Both are indefatigable in
collecting material from all quarters,&mdash;from other
histories and biographies, memoirs, letters, newspapers,
broadsides, and personal communications
gathered in many out-of-the-way localities. Both
have the power of discarding insignificant details
and retaining what is suggestive and picturesque.
Both, therefore, have the same supreme merit of
being interesting. Both have strong prejudices,
take sides earnestly, forget that they are narrators,
and begin to plead as attorneys and advocates.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
Both have been accused, rightly or wrongly, of
grave inaccuracies. But their defects will not prevent
them from holding their place as teachers of
the English-speaking public. English and American
readers will long continue to think of Marlborough
as Macaulay represents him; of Jackson
and Jefferson as Parton describes them. Such
Rembrandt-like portraits fix the attention by their
strange chiaro-oscuro. They may not be like nature,
but they take the place of nature. The most
remarkable instance of this kind is the representation
of Tiberius by Tacitus, which has caused
mankind, until very recently, to consider Tiberius
a monster of licentiousness and cruelty, in spite of
the almost self-evident absurdity and self-contradiction
of this <span class="locked">assumption.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span> Limners with such a
terrible power of portraiture should be very careful
how they use it, and not abuse the faculty in
the interest of their prejudices.</p>

<p>If Mr. Parton resembles Macaulay in some respects,
in one point, at least, he is like Carlyle:
that is, that his last hero is the least interesting.
From Schiller and Goethe to Frederic the Great
was a fall; and so from Franklin to Voltaire.
Carlyle tells us what a weary task he had with his
Prussian king, and we think that Mr. Parton's
labors over the patriarch of the eighteenth-century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
literature must have been equally distressing. At
a distance, Voltaire is a striking phenomenon: the
most brilliant wit of almost any period; the most
prolific writer; a successful dramatist, historian,
biographer, story-teller, controversialist, lyrical
poet, student of science. "Truly, a universal
genius, a mighty power!" we say. But look
more closely, and this genius turns into talent;
this encyclopædic knowledge becomes only superficial
half knowledge; this royalty is a sham royalty;
it does not lead the world, but follows it.
The work into which Voltaire put his heart was
destruction&mdash;the destruction of falsehoods, bigotries,
cruelties, and shams. It was an important
duty, and some one had to do it. But it was
temporary, and one of which the interest is soon
over. If Luther and the other reformers had
aimed at only destroying the Church of Rome,
their influence would have speedily ceased. But
they rebuilt, as they destroyed; the sword in one
hand, and the trowel in the other. They destroyed
in order to build; they took away the outgrown
house, to put another in its place. Voltaire did
not go so far as that; he wanted no new church
in the place of the old one.</p>

<p>Voltaire and Rousseau are often spoken of as
though they were fellow-workers, and are associated
in many minds as sharing the same convictions.
Nothing can be more untrue. They were
radically opposite in the very structure of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
minds, and their followers and admirers are
equally different. If all men can be divided into
Platonists and Aristotelians, they may be in like
manner classified as those who prefer Voltaire to
Rousseau, and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice versa</i>. Both were indeed theists,
and both opposed to the popular religion of
their time. Both were brilliant writers, masters
of the French language, listened to by the people,
and with a vast popularity. Both were more or
less persecuted for their religious heresies. So far
they resemble each other. But these are only
external resemblances; radically and inwardly
they were polar opposites. What attracted one
repelled the other. Voltaire was a man of the
world, fond of society and social pleasures; the
child of his time, popular, a universal favorite.
Rousseau shrank from society, hated its fashions,
did not enjoy its pleasures, and belonged to another
epoch than the eighteenth century. Rousseau
believed in human nature, and thought that
if we could return to our natural condition the
miseries of life would cease. Voltaire despised
human nature; he forever repeated that the majority
of men were knaves and fools. Rousseau
distrusted education and culture as they are commonly
understood; but to Voltaire's mind they
were the only matters of any value,&mdash;all that
made life worth living. Rousseau was more like
Pascal than like Voltaire; far below Pascal, no
doubt, in fixed moral principles and ascetic virtue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
Yet he resembled him in his devotion to ideas, his
enthusiasm for some better day to come. Both
were out of place in their own time; both were
prophets crying in the wilderness. Put Voltaire
between Pascal and Rousseau, and it would be
something like the tableau of Goethe between
Basedow and Lavater.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem" xml:lang="de" lang="de">
<span class="i0q">"Prophete rechts, Propliete links,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Das Weltkind in der Mitte."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">The difference between Voltaire and Rousseau was
really that between a man of talent and a man of
genius. Voltaire, brilliant, adroit, full of resource,
quick as a flash, versatile, with immense powers of
working, with a life full of literary successes, has
not left behind him a single masterpiece. He
comes in everywhere second best. As a tragedian
he is inferior to Racine; as a wit and comic writer
far below Molière; and he is quite surpassed as a
historian and biographer by many modern French
authors. No germinating ideas are to be found in
his writings, no seed corn for future harvests. He
thought himself a philosopher, and was so regarded
by others; but neither had his philosophy
any roots to it. A sufficient proof of this is the
fact that he shared the superficial optimism of the
English deists, as expressed by Bolingbroke and
Pope, until the Lisbon earthquake, by destroying
thirty thousand people, changed his whole mental
attitude. Till then he could say with Pope,
"Whatever is, is right." After that, most things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
which are, appeared to him fatally and hopelessly
wrong. That thirty thousand persons should perish
in a few minutes, in great suffering, he thought
inconsistent with the goodness of God. But take
the whole world over, thirty thousand people are
continually perishing, in the course of a few hours
or days. What difference does it make, in a
philosophical point of view, if they die all at once
in a particular place, or at longer intervals in
many places? Voltaire asks, "What crime had
those infants committed who lie crushed on their
mother's breasts?" What crime, we reply, have
the infants committed who have been dying by
millions, in suffering, since the world began?
"Was Lisbon," he asks, "more wicked than
Paris?" But had Voltaire never noticed before
that wicked people often live on in health and
pleasure, while the good suffer and die? Voltaire
did not see, what it requires very little philosophy
to discover, that a Lisbon earthquake really presents
no more difficulty to the reason than the
suffering and death of a single child.</p>

<p>Another fact which shows the shallow nature of
Voltaire's way of thinking is his expectation of
destroying Christianity by a combined attack upon
it of all the wits and philosophers. Mr. Parton
tells us that "l'Infâme," which Voltaire expected
to crush, "was not religion, nor the Christian
religion, nor the Roman Catholic Church. It was,"
he says, "<em>religion claiming supernatural authority,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
and enforcing that claim by pains and penalties</em>."
No doubt it was the spirit of intolerance
and persecution which excited his indignation.
But the object of that indignation was not the
abstraction which Mr. Parton presents to us. It
was something far more concrete. There is no
doubt that Voltaire confounded Christianity with
the churches about him, and these with their
abuses; and thus his object was to sweep away all
positive religious institutions, and to leave in their
place a philosophic deism. Else what meaning in
his famous boast that "it required twelve men to
found a belief, which it would need only one man
to destroy"? What meaning, otherwise, in his
astonishment that Locke, "having in one book so
profoundly traced the development of the understanding,
could so degrade his own understanding
in another"?&mdash;referring, as Mr. Morley believes,
to Locke's "Reasonableness of Christianity." Voltaire
saw around him Christianity represented by
cruel bigots, ecclesiastics living in indolent luxury,
narrow-minded and hard-hearted priests. That
was all the Christianity he saw with his sharp perceptive
faculty; and he had no power of penetrating
into the deeper life of the soul which these
corruptions misrepresented. We do not blame
him for this; he was made so; but it was a fatal
defect in a reformer. The first work of a reformer
is to discover the truth and the good latent
amid the abuses he wishes to reform, and for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
sake of which men endure the evil. A Buddhist
proverb says, "The human mind is like a leech:
it never lets go with its tail till it has taken hold
somewhere else with its head." Distinguish the
good in a system from the evil; show how the
good can be preserved, though the evil is abandoned,
and then you may hope to effect a truly
radical reform. Radicalism means going to the
roots of anything. Voltaire was incapable of becoming
a radical reformer of the Christian Church,
because he had in himself no faculty by which he
could appreciate the central forces of Christianity.
Mr. Morley says that Voltaire "has said no word,
nor even shown an indirect appreciation of any
word said by another, which stirs and expands
that indefinite exaltation known as the love of
God," "or of the larger word holiness." "Through
the affronts which his reason received from certain
pretensions, both in the writers and in some of
those whose actions they commemorated, this sublime
trait in the Bible, in both portions of it, was
unhappily lost to Voltaire. He had no ear for the
finer vibrations of the spiritual voice." And so
also speaks Carlyle: "It is a much more serious
ground of offense that he intermeddled in religion
without being himself, in any measure, religious;
that he entered the temple and continued there
with a levity which, in any temple where men
worship, can beseem no brother man; that, in a
word, he ardently, and with long-continued effort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
warred against Christianity, without understanding
beyond the mere superficies of what Christianity
was." In fact, in the organization of Voltaire,
the organ of reverence, "the crown of the whole
moral nature," seems to have been at its minimum.
A sense of justice there was; an ardent sympathy
with the oppressed, a generous hatred of the oppressor,
a ready devotion of time, thought, wealth,
to the relief of the down-trodden victim. Therefore,
with such qualities, Voltaire, by the additional
help of his indefatigable energy, often succeeded
in plucking the prey from the jaws of the
lion. He was able to defeat the combined powers
of Church and State in his advocacy of some individual
sufferer, in his battle against some single
wrong. But his long war against the Catholic
Church in France left it just where it was when
that war began. Its power to-day in France is
greater than it was then, because it is a purer and
better institution than it was then. That Sphinx
still sits by the roadside propounding its riddle.
Voltaire was not the &OElig;dipus who could solve it,
and so the life of that mystery remains untouched
until now.</p>

<p>The Henriade has often been considered the
great epic poem of France. This merely means
that France has never produced a great epic poem.
The Henriade is artificial, prosaic, and has no
particle of the glow, the fire, the prolonged enthusiasm,
which alone can give an epic poem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
mankind. In this sentence all competent critics
are agreed.</p>

<p>Voltaire was busy with literature during his
whole life. He not only wrote continually himself,
but he was a critic of the writings of others.
His mind was essentially critical,&mdash;formed to
analyze, discriminate sharply, compare, and judge
by some universal standard of taste. Here, if
anywhere, he ought to be at his best; here, if in
any department, he should stand at the head of
the world's board of literary censors. But here,
again, he is not even second-rate; here, more than
elsewhere, he shows how superficial are his judgments.
He tests every writer by the French
standard in the eighteenth century. Every word
which Goethe, Schiller, Lessing, have said of
other writers is full of value and interest to-day.
But who would go to Voltaire for light on any
book or author? We have an instinctive but certain
conviction that all his views are limited by
his immediate environment, perverted by his personal
prejudices. Thus, he prefers Ariosto to the
Odyssey, and Tasso's Jerusalem to the <span class="locked">Iliad.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span>
His inability to comprehend the greatness of
Shakespeare is well known. He is filled with
indignation because a French critic had called
Shakespeare "the god of the stage." "The blood
boils in my old veins," says he; "and what is
frightful to think of, it was I myself who first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
showed to Frenchmen the few pearls to be found
in the <span class="locked">dunghill."<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span> Chesterfield's Letters to his
Son he considers "the best book upon education
ever <span class="locked">written."<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span> This is the book in which a
father teaches his son the art of polite falsehood,
of which Dr. Johnson says that "it shows how
grace can be united with wickedness,"&mdash;the book
whose author is called by De Vere the philosopher
of flattery and dissimulation. He admitted that
there were some good things in Milton, but speaks
of his conceptions as "odd and <span class="locked">extravagant."<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span>
He thought Condorcet much superior to Pascal.
The verses of Helvetius he believed better than
any but those of Racine. The era was what Villemain
calls "the golden age of mediocre writers;"
and Voltaire habitually praised them all. But
these writers mostly belonged to a mutual admiration
society. The anatomist Tissot, in one of his
physiological works, says that the genius of Diderot
came to show to mankind how every variety of
talent could be brought to perfection in one man.
Diderot, in his turn, went into frantic delight over
the novels of Richardson. "Since I have read
these works," he says, "I make them my touchstone;
those who do not admire them are self-condemned.
O my friends, what majestic dramas
are these three, Clarissa, Sir Charles Grandison,
and Pamela!" Such was the eighteenth century;
and Voltaire belonged to it with all the intensity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
of his ardent nature. He may be said never to
have seen or foreseen anything better. Living on
the very verge of a great social revolution, he does
not appear to have suspected what its nature
would be, even if he suspected its approach. The
cruelties of the Church exasperated him, but the
political condition of society, the misery of the
peasants, the luxury of the nobles, the despotism
of the king, left him unmoved. He was singularly
deficient in any conception of the value of political
liberty or of free institutions. If he had lived to
see the coming of the Revolution, it would have
utterly astounded him. His sympathies were with
an enlightened aristocracy, not with the people.
In this, too, he was the man of his time, and belonged
to the middle of his century, not the end of
it. He saw and lamented the evils of bad government.
He pointed out the miseries produced by
war. He abhorred and denounced the military
spirit. He called on the clergy, in the name of
their religion, to join him in his righteous appeals
against this great curse of mankind. "Where,"
he asks, "in the five or six thousand sermons of
Massillon, are there two in which anything is said
against the scourge of war?" He rebukes the
philosophers and moralists, also, for their delinquency
in this matter, and replies forcibly to Montesquieu's
argument that self-defense sometimes
makes it necessary to begin the attack on a neighboring
nation. But he does not go back to trace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
the evil to its root in the absence of self-government.
In a letter to the King of Prussia he says,
"When I asked you to become the deliverer of
Greece, I did not mean to have you restore the
democracy. I do not love the rule of the rabble"
(<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gouvernement de la canaille</i>). Again, writing to
the same, in January, 1757, he says, "Your majesty
will confer a great benefit by destroying this
infamous superstition [Christianity]; I do not say
among the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">canaille</i>, who do not deserve to be enlightened,
and who ought to be kept down under
all yokes, but among honest people, people who
think. Give white bread to the children, but only
black bread to the dogs." In 1762, writing to the
Marquis d'Argens, he says, "The Turks say that
their Koran has sometimes the face of an angel,
sometimes the face of a beast. This description
suits our time. There are a few philosophers,&mdash;they
have the face of an angel; all else much
resembles that of a beast." Again, he says to
Helvetius, "Consider no man your neighbor but
the man who thinks; look on all other men as
wolves, foxes, and deer." "We shall soon see,"
he writes to D'Alembert, "new heavens and a
new earth,&mdash;I mean for honest people; for as to
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">canaille</i>, the stupidest heaven and earth is all
they are fit for." The real government of nations,
according to him, should be administered by absolute
kings, in the interest of freethinkers.</p>

<p>It is true that after Rousseau had published his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
trumpet-call in behalf of democratic rights, Voltaire
began to waver. It has been remarked that
"at the very time when he expressed an increasing
ill-will against the person of the author of 'Emile,'
he was irresistibly attracted to the principal doctrines
of Rousseau. He entered, as if in spite of
himself, into paths toward which his feet were
never before directed. As if to revenge himself
for coming under this salutary influence, he pursued
Rousseau with blind <span class="locked">anger."<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span> He harshly
attacked the Social Contract, but accepted the
sovereignty of the people; saying that "civil government
is the will of all, executed by a single
one, or by several, in virtue of the laws which all
have enacted." He, however, speedily restricted
this democratic principle by confining the right of
making laws to the owners of real estate. He declares
that those who have neither house nor land
ought not to have any voice in the matter. He
now began (in 1764) to look forward to the end
of monarchies, and to expect a revolution. Nevertheless,
he plainly declares, "The pretended
equality of man is a pernicious chimera. If there
were not thirty laborers to one master, the earth
would not be cultivated." But in practical and
humane reforms Voltaire took the lead, and did
good work. He opposed examination by torture,
the punishment of death for theft, the confiscation
of the property of the condemned, the penalties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
against heretics; secret trials; praised trial by
jury, civil marriage, right of divorce, and reforms
in the direction of hygiene and education.</p>

<p>And, above all, whatever fault may be found
with Voltaire, let us never cease to appreciate his
generous efforts in behalf of the unfortunate victims
of the atrocious bigotry which then prevailed
in France. It is not necessary to dwell here on
the cases of Calas, the Sirvens, La Barre, and the
Count de Lally. They are fully told by Mr. Parton,
and to his account we refer our readers. In
1762 the Protestant pastor Rochette was hanged,
by order of the Parliament of Toulouse, for having
exercised his ministry in Languedoc. At the same
time three young gentlemen, Protestants, were beheaded,
for having taken arms to defend themselves
from being slaughtered by the Catholics.
In 1762, the Protestant merchant Calas, an aged
and worthy citizen of Toulouse, was tortured and
broken on the wheel, on a wholly unsupported
charge of having killed his son to keep him from
turning Catholic. A Protestant girl named Sirven
was, about the same time, taken from her parents,
and shut up in a convent, to compel her to change
her religion. She escaped, and perished by accident
during her flight. The parents were accused
of having killed her to keep her from becoming a
Catholic. They escaped, but the wife died of exposure
and want. In 1766 a crucifix was injured
by some wanton persons. The Bishop of Amiens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
called out for vengeance. Two young officers,
eighteen years old, were accused. One escaped;
the other, La Barre, was condemned to have his
tongue cut out, his right hand cut off, and to be
burned alive. The sentence was commuted to death
by decapitation. Voltaire, seventy years old, devoted
himself with masterly ability and untiring
energy to save these victims; and when he failed
in that, to show the falsehood of the charges, and
to obtain a revision of the judgments. He used
all means: personal appeals to men in power and
to female favorites, eloquence, wit, pathos in every
form of writing. He called on all his friends to
aid him. He poured a flood of light into these
dark places of iniquity. His generous labors were
crowned with success. He procured a reversal of
these iniquitous decisions; in some cases a restoration
of the confiscated property, and a public
recognition of the innocence of those condemned.
Without knowing it, he was acting as a disciple
of Jesus. Perhaps he may have met in the other
world with the great leader of humanity, whom he
never understood below, and been surprised to hear
him say, "Inasmuch as thou hast done it to the
least of my little ones, thou hast done it unto me."</p>

<p>Carlyle tells us that the chief quality of Voltaire
was <em>adroitness</em>. He denies that he was really a
great man, and says that in one essential mark
of greatness he was wholly wanting, that is, earnestness.
He adds that Voltaire was by birth a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
mocker; that this was the irresistible bias of his
disposition; that the first question with him was
always not what is true but what is false, not what
is to be loved but what is to be contemned. He
was shallow without heroism, full of pettiness, full
of vanity; "not a great man, but only a great <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">persifleur</i>."</p>

<p>But certainly some other qualities than these
were essential to produce the immense influence
which he exerted in his own time, and since. Beside
the extreme adroitness of which Carlyle speaks,
he had as exhaustless an energy as was ever granted
to any of the sons of men. He was never happy
except when he was at work. He worked at home,
he worked when visiting, he worked in his carriage,
he worked at hotels. Amid annoyances and disturbances
which would have paralyzed the thought
and pen of others, Voltaire labored on. Upon his
sick bed, in extreme debility and in old age, that
untiring pen was ever in motion, and whatever
came from it interested all mankind. Besides the
innumerable books, tracts, and treatises which fill
the volumes of his collected works, there are said
to be in existence fourteen thousand of his letters,
half of which have never been printed. But this
was only a part of the outcome of his terrible vitality.
He was also an enterprising and energetic
man of business. He speculated in the funds, lent
money on interest, fitted out ships, bought and sold
real estate, solicited and obtained pensions. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
way he changed his patrimony of about two hundred
thousand francs to an annual income of the
same amount,&mdash;equal to at least one hundred
thousand dollars a year at the present time. He
was determined to be rich, and he became so; not
because he loved money for itself, nor because he
was covetous. He gave money freely; he used it
in large ways. He sought wealth as a means of
self-defense,&mdash;to protect himself against the persecution
which his attacks on the Church might bring
upon him. He also had, like a great writer of the
present century, Walter Scott, the desire of being
a large landed proprietor and lord of a manor;
and, like Scott, he became one, reigning at Ferney
as Scott ruled at Abbotsford.</p>

<p>In defending himself against his persecutors he
used other means not so legitimate. One of his
methods was systematic falsehood. He first concealed,
and then denied, the authorship of any
works which would expose him to danger. He took
the tone of injured innocence. For example, he
had worked with delight, during twenty years, on
his wretched "Pucelle." To write new lines in it,
or a new canto, was his refreshment; to read them
to his friends gave him the most intense satisfaction.
But when the poem found its way into print,
with what an outcry he denies the authorship, almost
before he is charged with it. He assumes
the air of calumniated virtue. The charge, he declares,
is one of the infamous inventions of his enemies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
He writes to the "Journal Encyclopédique,"
"The crowning point of their devilish man&oelig;uvres
is the edition of a poem called 'La Pucelle d'Orléans.'
The editor has the face to attribute this
work to the author of the 'Henriade,' the 'Zaïre,'
the 'Mérope,' the 'Alzire,' the 'Siècle de Louis
XIV.' He dares to ascribe to this author the flattest,
meanest, and most gross work which can come
from the press. My pen refuses to copy the tissue
of silly and abominable obscenities of this work
of darkness." When the "Dictionnaire Philosophique"
began to appear, he wrote to D'Alembert,
"As soon as any danger arises, I beg you will let
me know, that I may disavow the work in all the
public papers with my usual candor and innocence."
Mr. Parton tells us that he had <em>a hundred and
eight</em> pseudonyms. He signed his pamphlets A
Benedictine, The Archbishop of Canterbury, A
Quaker, Rev. Josias Roussette, the Abbé Lilladet,
the Abbé Bigorre, the Pastor Bourn. He was also
ready to tell a downright lie when it suited his convenience.</p>

<p>When "Candide" was printed, in 1758, he
wrote, as Mr. Parton tells us, to a friendly pastor
in Geneva, "I have at length read 'Candide.'
People must have lost their senses to attribute to
me that pack of nonsense. I have, thank God,
better occupation. This optimism [of Pangloss]
obviously destroys the foundation of our holy religion."
Our holy religion!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
An excuse may be found for these falsehoods.
A writer, it may be said, has a right to his incognito;
if so, he has a right to protect it by denying
the authorship of a book when charged with it.
This is doubtful morality, but Voltaire went far
beyond this. He volunteered his denials. He asserted
in every way, with the most solemn asseverations,
that he was not the author of a book which
he had written with delight. But this was not the
worst. He not only told these author's lies, but
he was a deliberate hypocrite, professing faith in
Christianity, receiving its sacraments, asking spiritual
help from the Pope, and begging for relics
from the Vatican, at the very time that he was
hoping by strenuous efforts to destroy both Catholicism
and Christianity.</p>

<p>When he was endeavoring to be admitted to a
place in the French Academy, he wrote thus to the
Bishop of <span class="locked">Mirepoix:<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span> "Thanks to Heaven, my religion
teaches me to know how to suffer. The
God who founded it, as soon as he deigned to become
man, was of all men the most persecuted.
After such an example, it is almost a crime to
complain.... I can say, before God who hears
me, that I am a good citizen and a true Catholic....
I have written many pages sanctified by religion."
In this Mr. Parton admits that he went
too far.</p>

<p>When at Colmar, as a measure of self-protection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
he resolved to commune at Easter. Mr. Parton
says that Voltaire had pensions and rents to
the amount of sixty thousand livres annually, of
which the king could deprive him by a stroke
of the pen. So he determined to prove himself
a good Catholic by taking the sacraments. As a
necessary preliminary, he confessed to a Capuchin
monk. He wrote to D'Argens just before, "If I
had a hundred thousand men, I know what I
should do; but as I have them not, I shall commune
at Easter!" But, writing to Rousseau, he
thinks it shameful in Galileo to retract his opinions.
Mr. Parton too, who is disposed to excuse
some of these hypocrisies in Voltaire, is scandalized
because the pastors of Geneva denied the
charges of heresy brought against them by Voltaire;
saying that "we live, as they lived, in an
atmosphere of insincerity." In the midst of all
this, Voltaire took credit to himself for his frank
avowals of the truth: "I am not wrong to dare to
utter what worthy men think. For forty years I
have braved the base empire of the despots of the
mind." Mr. Parton elsewhere seems to think it
would have been impossible for Voltaire to versify
the Psalms; as it was "asked him to give the lie
publicly to his whole career." But if communing
at Easter did not do this, how could a versification
of a few psalms accomplish it? Parton quotes
Condorcet as saying that Voltaire could not become
a hypocrite, even to be a cardinal. Could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
any one do a more hypocritical action than to partake
the sacraments of a Church which he despised
in order to escape the danger of persecution?</p>

<p>When building his house at Ferney, the neighboring
Catholic curés interfered with him. They
prohibited the laborers from working for him. To
meet this difficulty he determined to obtain the
protection of the Pope himself. So he wrote to
the Pope, asking for a relic to put in the church
he had built, and received in return a piece of the
hair-shirt of St. Francis. He went to mass frequently.
Meantime, in his letters to his brother
freethinkers, he added his usual postscript, "Ecrasez
l'Infâme;" begging their aid in crushing
Catholicism and Christianity. Yet it does not
seem that he considered himself a hypocrite in
thus conforming outwardly to a religion which he
hated. He thinks that others who do so are hypocrites,
but not that he is one. In 1764 he writes
to Madame du Deffand, "The worst is that we
are surrounded by hypocrites, who worry us to
make us think what they themselves do not think
at all." So singular are the self-deceptions of the
human mind. He writes to Frederic ridiculing
the sacrament of extreme unction, and then solemnly
partakes of the eucharist. Certainly he
did not belong to the noble army of martyrs. He
expected to overturn a great religious system, not
by the power of faith, but by ingenious pamphlets,
brilliant sarcasms, adroit deceptions. In thus
thinking he was eminently superficial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
His theory on this subject is given in an article
in the "Dictionnaire Philosophique," quoted by
Mr. Parton: "Distinguish honest people who think,
from the populace who were not made to think.
If usage obliges you to perform a ridiculous ceremony
for the sake of the canaille, and on the road
you meet some people of understanding, notify
them by a sign of the head, or a look, that you
think as they do.... If imbeciles still wish to
eat acorns, let them have acorns."</p>

<p>Mr. Parton describes in full (vol. ii. p. 410)
the ceremony of the eucharist of which Voltaire
partook in his own church at Ferney. It was
Easter Sunday, and Voltaire mounted the pulpit
and preached a sermon against theft. Hearing of
this, the bishop was scandalized, and forbade all
the curates of the diocese from confessing, absolving,
or giving the sacrament to Voltaire. Upon
this Voltaire writes and signs a formal demand on
the curate of Ferney to allow him to confess and
commune in the Catholic Church, in which he was
born, has lived, and wishes to die; offering to
make all necessary declarations, all requisite protestations,
in public or private, submitting himself
absolutely to all the rules of the Church, for the
edification of Catholics and Protestants. All this
was a mere piece of mystification and fun. He
pretended to be too sick to go to the church, and
made a Capuchin come and administer the eucharist
to him in bed; Voltaire saying, "Having my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
God in my mouth, I declare that I forgive all my
enemies." No wonder that with all his marvelous
ability and his long war upon the Catholic Church
he was unable to make any lasting impression upon
it. Talent is not enough to make revolutions of
opinion. No serious faith was ever destroyed by
a jest.</p>

<p>If we return to Rousseau, and compare his influence
with that of Voltaire, we shall find that it
went far deeper. Voltaire was a man of immense
talent. Talent originates nothing, but formulates
into masterly expression what has come to it from
the age in which it lives. Not a new idea can be
found, we believe, in all Voltaire's innumerable
writings. But genius has a vision of ideal truth.
It is a prophet of the future. Rousseau, with his
many faults, weaknesses, follies, was a man of genius.
He was probably the most eloquent writer of
French prose who has ever appeared. He was a
man possessed by his ideas. He had none of the
adroitness, wit, ingenuity, of Voltaire. Instead
of amassing an enormous fortune, he supported
himself by copying music. Instead of being surrounded
by admirers and flatterers, he led a solitary
life, alone with his ideas. Instead of denying
the authorship of his works, and so giving an
excuse to the authorities to leave him quiet, he put
his name to his writings. He worked for his
bread with his hands, and in his "Emile" he recommended
that all boys should be taught some manual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
craft. Voltaire ridiculed the <em>gentleman carpenter</em>
of Rousseau; but before that generation
passed away, many a French nobleman had reason
to lament that he had not been taught to use
the saw and the plane.</p>

<p>If Voltaire belonged to the eighteenth century,
and brought to a brilliant focus its scattered
rays, Rousseau belonged more to the nineteenth.
Amidst the <em>persiflage</em>, the mockery, the light and
easy philosophy, of his day, he stood, "among
them, but not of them, in a crowd of thoughts
which were not their thoughts." This is the true
explanation of his weakness and strength, and of
the intense dislike felt for him by Voltaire and
the school of Voltaire. They belonged to their
time, Rousseau to a coming time.</p>

<p>The eighteenth century, especially in France,
was one in which nature was at its minimum and
art at its maximum. All was art. But art separated
from nature becomes artificial, not to say
artful. Decorum was the law in morals; the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bienséances</i> and <em>convenances</em> ruled in society.
The stage was bound by conventional rules. Poetry
walked in silk attire, and made its toilette
with the elaborate dignity of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">levée</i> of the
Grand Monarque. Against all this Rousseau led
the reaction&mdash;the reaction inevitable as destiny.
As art had been pushed to an extreme, so now
naturalism was carried to the opposite extreme.
Rousseau was the apostle of nature in all things.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
Children were to be educated by the methods of
nature, not according to the routine of old custom.
Governments were to go back to their origin in
human nature; society was to be reorganized on
first principles. This voice crying in the wilderness
was like the trumpet of doom to the age, announcing
the age to come. It laid the axe at the
root of the tree. Its outcome was the French
Revolution, that rushing, mighty flood, which carried
away the throne, the aristocracy, the manners,
laws, and prejudices of the past.</p>

<p>In his first great work, the work which startled
Europe, Rousseau recalled man to himself. He
said, "The true philosophy is to commune with
one's self,"&mdash;the greatest saying, thinks Henri
Martin, that had been pronounced in that century.
Rousseau condemned luxury, and uttered a prophetic
cry of woe over the tangled perplexities of
the time. "There is no longer a remedy, <em>unless
through some great revolution, almost as much to
be feared as the evil it would cure,&mdash;which it is
blamable to desire, impossible to foresee</em>."</p>

<p>"<em>Man is naturally good</em>," says Rousseau. Before
the frightful words "mine" and "thine"
were invented, how could there have been, he
asks, any vices or crimes? He denounced all
slavery, all inequality, all forms of oppression.
His writings were full of exaggeration, but, says
the French historian, "no sooner had he opened
his lips than he restored earnestness to the world."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
The same writer, after speaking of the faults of
the "Nouvelle Héloïse," adds that nevertheless "a
multitude of the letters of his 'Julie' are masterpieces
of eloquence, passion, and profundity; and
the last portions are signalized by a moral purity,
a wisdom of views, and a religious elevation
altogether new in the France of the eighteenth century."
Concerning "Emile," he says, "It is the profoundest
study of human nature in our language;
it was an ark of safety, launched by Providence
on the waves of skepticism and materialism. If
Rousseau had been stricken out of the eighteenth
century, whither, we seriously ask, would the human
mind have drifted?"<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>The "Social Contract" appeared in 1762. In
this work Rousseau swept away by his powerful
eloquence the arguments which placed sovereignty
elsewhere than in the hands of the people. This
fundamental idea was the seed corn which broke
from the earth in the first Revolution, and bears its
ripe fruit in republican France to-day. D'Alembert,
who disliked Rousseau, said of "Emile"
that "it placed him at the head of all writers."
The "Social Contract," illogical and unsound in
many things, yet tore down the whole framework
of despotism. Van Laun, a more recent historian,
tells us that Rousseau was a man of the
people, who knew all their wants; that every vice
he attacked was one that they saw really present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
in their midst; that he "opened the flood-gates of
suppressed desires, which gushed forth, overwhelming
a whole artificial world." Villemain
writes that the words of Rousseau, "descending
like a flame of fire, moved the souls of his contemporaries;"
and that "his books glow with an
eloquence which can never pass away." Morley,
to whom Rousseau is essentially antipathic, says of
the "Social Contract" that its first words, "Man
is born free, but is everywhere in chains," thrilled
two continents,&mdash;that it was the gospel of the
Jacobins; and the action of the convention in
1794 can be explained only by the influence of
Rousseau. He taught France to believe in a government
of the people, by the people, and for the
people. Locke had already taught this doctrine
in England, where it produced no such violent
outbreak, because it encountered no such glaring
abuses.</p>

<p>Such is the striking contrast between these two
greatest writers in modern French literature. It
is singular to observe their instinctive antagonism
in every point of belief and character. The merits
of one are precisely opposite to those of the other:
their faults are equally opposed.</p>

<p>The events of Voltaire's life have been so often
told that Mr. Parton has not been able to add
much to our knowledge of his biography. He was
born in 1694 and died in 1778, at the age of
eighty-four, though at his birth he was so feeble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
that those who believe that the world's progress
depends on the survival of the fittest would have
thought him not fit to be brought up. This was
also the case with Goethe and Walter Scott. His
father was a notary, and the name Arouet had
that of Voltaire added to it, it being a name in his
mother's family. This affix was adopted by the
lad when in the Bastille, at the age of twenty-four.
As a duck takes to water, so Voltaire took to his
pen. In his twelfth year he wrote verses addressed
to the Dauphin, which so pleased the
famous Ninon de l'Enclos, then in her ninetieth
year, that she left the boy a legacy of two thousand
francs. He went to a Jesuits' school, and
always retained a certain liking for the Jesuits.
His father wished to make him a notary, but he
would "pen a stanza when he should engross;"
and the usual struggles between the paternal purpose
and the filial instinct ended, as usual, in the
triumph of the latter. He led a wild career for a
time, in the society of dissipated abbès, debauched
noblemen, and women to whom pleasure was the
only object. Suspected of having written a lampoon
on the death of Louis XIV., he was sent to
the Bastille, and came forth not only with a new
name, but with literature as his aim for the rest of
his life. His first play appeared on the stage in
1718, and from that time he continued to write
till his death. He traveled from the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">château</i> of
one nobleman to another, pouring out his satires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
and sarcasms through the press; threatened by
the angry rulers and priests who governed France,
but always escaping by some adroit man&oelig;uvre.
In England he became a deist and a mathematician.
His views of Christ and Christianity were
summed up in a quatrain which may be thus
translated. Speaking of Jesus, he <span class="locked">says,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"His actions are holy, his ethics divine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into hearts which are wounded he pours oil and wine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if, through imposture, those truths are received,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It still is a blessing to be thus deceived."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">He lived many years at Cirey with the Marchioness
of Châtelet; the marquis, her husband, accepting
the curious relation without any objection.
Then followed the still stranger episode of his
residence with Frederic the Great, their love quarrels
and reconciliations. After this friendship
came to an end, Voltaire went to live near Geneva
in Switzerland, but soon bought another estate
just out of Switzerland, in France, and a third a
short distance away, in the territory of another
power. Thus, if threatened in one state, he could
easily pass into another. Here he lived and
worked till the close of his life, an untiring writer.
He was a man of infinite wit, kind-hearted, with
little malignity of any sort, wishing in the main
to do good. His violent attacks upon Christianity
may be explained by the fact of the corruptions of
the Church which were around him. The Church
of France in that day, in its higher circles, was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
persecuting Church, yet without faith: greedy for
wealth, living in luxury, careless of the poor, and
well deserving the attacks of Voltaire. That he
could not look deeper and see the need of religious
institutions of a better sort was his misfortune.</p>

<p>This work is a storehouse of facts for the history
of Voltaire and his time. We do not think it will
materially alter the judgment pronounced on him
by such critics as Carlyle, Morley, and the majority
of French writers in our day. Voltaire was a shining
light in his age, but that age has gone by, and
can never return.</p>

<p class="p2">It is natural and fit that many pulpits to-day
should take for their theme the character and influence
of the great thinker and poet who has just
left us; for every such soul is a new revelation of
God's truth and love. Each opens the gateway between
our lower world of earthly care and earthly
pleasure into a higher heavenly world of spirit.
Such men lift our lives to a higher plane, and convince
us that we, also, belong to God, to eternity,
to heaven. And few, in our day, have been such
mediators of heavenly things to mankind as Ralph
Waldo Emerson.</p>

<p>Last Sunday afternoon, when the town of Concord
was mourning through all its streets for the
loss of its beloved and revered citizen; when the
humblest cottage had on its door the badge of sorrow;
when great numbers came from abroad to
testify their affection and respect, that which impressed
me the most was the inevitable response
of the human heart to whatever is true and good.
Cynics may tell us that men are duped by charlatans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
led by selfish demagogues, incapable of knowing
honor and truth when set before them; that
they always stone their prophets and crucify their
saviors; that they have eyes, and do not see; ears,
and never hear. This is all true for a time; but
inevitably, by a law as sure as that which governs
the movements of the planets, the souls of men
turn at last toward what is true, generous, and
noble. The prophets and teachers of the race may
be stoned by one generation, but their monuments
are raised by the next. They are misunderstood
and misrepresented to-day, but to-morrow they become
the accredited leaders of their time. Jesus,
who knew well that he would be rejected and murdered
by a people blind and deaf to his truth, also
knew that this truth would sooner or later break
down all opposition, and make him master and
king of the world. "I, if I be lifted up, will draw
all men unto me."</p>

<p>Last Sunday afternoon, as the grateful procession
followed their teacher to his grave in the Concord
cemetery, the harshness of our spring seemed
to relent, and Nature became tender toward him
who had loved her so well. I thought of his words,
"The visible heavens and earth sympathized with
Jesus." The town where "the embattled farmers
stood;" where the musket was discharged which
opened the War of the Revolution&mdash;the gun of
which Lafayette said, "It was the alarm-gun of the
world;" the town of Hawthorne's "Old Manse,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
and of his grave, now that Emerson also sleeps in
its quiet valley, has received an added glory. It
has become one of the "Meccas of the mind."</p>

<p>Let me describe the mental and spiritual condition
of New England when Emerson appeared.
Calvinism, with its rigorous dogmatism, was slowly
dying, and had been succeeded by a calm and somewhat
formal rationalism. Locke was still the master
in the realm of thought; Addison and Blair in
literary expression. In poetry, the school of Pope
was engaged in conflict with that of Byron and his
contemporaries. Wordsworth had led the way to
a deeper view of nature; but Wordsworth could
scarcely be called a popular writer. In theology a
certain literalism prevailed, and the doctrines of
Christianity were inferred from counting and weighing
texts on either side. Not the higher reason,
with its intuition of eternal ideas, but the analytic
understanding, with its logical methods, was considered
to be the ruler in the world of thought.
There was more of culture than of intellectual life,
more of good habits than of moral enthusiasm.
Religion had become very much of an external
institution. Christianity consisted in holding rational
or orthodox opinions, going regularly to
church, and listening every Sunday to a certain
number of prayers, hymns, and sermons. These
sermons, with some striking exceptions, were rather
tame and mechanical. In Boston, it is true, Buckminster
had appeared,&mdash;that soul of flame which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
soon wore to decay its weak body. The consummate
orator Edward Everett had followed him in
Brattle Square pulpit. Above all, Channing had
looked, with a new spiritual insight, into the truths
of religion and morality. But still the mechanical
treatment prevailed in a majority of the churches
of New England, and was considered, on the whole,
to be the wisest and safest method. There was an
unwritten creed of morals, literature, and social
thought to which all were expected to conform.
There was little originality and much repetition.
On all subjects there were certain formulas which
it was considered proper to repeat. "Thou art a
blessed fellow," says one of Shakespeare's characters,
"to think as other people think. Not a man's
thought in the world keeps the roadway better than
thine." The thought of New England kept the
roadway. Of course, at all times a large part of
the belief of the community is derived from memory,
custom, and imitation; but in those days, if
I remember them aright, it was regarded as a kind
of duty to think as every one else thought; a sort
of delinquency, or weakness, to differ from the majority.</p>

<p>If the movements of thought are now much
more independent and spontaneous; if to-day traditions
have lost their despotic power; if even
those who hold an orthodox creed are able to treat
it as a dead letter, respectable for its past uses,
but by no means binding on us now, this is largely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
owing to the manly position taken by Emerson.
And yet, let it be observed, this influence was not
exercised by attacking old opinions, by argument,
by denial, by criticism. Theodore Parker did all
this, but his influence on thought has been far less
than that of Emerson. Parker was a hero who
snuffed the battle afar off, and flung himself,
sword in hand, into the thick of the conflict. But,
much as we love and reverence his honesty, his
immense activity, his devotion to truth and right,
we must admit to-day, standing by these two
friendly graves, that the power of Emerson to
soften the rigidity of time-hardened belief was far
the greater. It is the old fable of the storm and
sun. The violent attacks of the tempest only
made the traveler cling more closely to his cloak;
the genial heat of the sun compelled him to throw
it aside. In all Emerson's writings there is
scarcely any argument. He attacks no man's belief;
he simply states his own. His method is
always positive, constructive. He opens the windows
and lets in more light. He is no man's
opponent; the enemy of no one. He states what
he sees, and that which he does not see he passes
by. He was often attacked, but never replied.
His answer was to go forward, and say something
else. He did not care for what he called the
"bugbear consistency." If to-day he said what
seemed like Pantheism, and to-morrow he saw
some truth which seemed to reveal a divine personality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
a supreme will, he uttered the last, as he
had declared the first, always faithful to the light
within. He left it to the spirit of truth to reconcile
such apparent contradictions. He was like
his own humble-bee&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"Seeing only what is fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sipping only what is sweet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou dost mock at fate and care,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Leave the chaff and take the wheat."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>By this method of positive statement he not
only saved the time usually wasted in argument,
attack, reply, rejoinder, but he gave us the substance
of Truth, instead of its form. Logic and
metaphysic reveal no truths; they merely arrange
in order what the higher faculties of the mind
have made known. Hence the speedy oblivion
which descends on polemics of all sorts. The
great theological debaters, where are they? The
books of Horsley and McGee are buried in
the same grave with those of Belsham and
Priestley, their old opponents. The bitter attacks
on Christianity by Voltaire and Paine are inurned
in the same dark and forgotten vaults with the
equally bitter defenses of Christianity by its
numerous champions. Argument may often be
necessary, but no truth is slain by argument; no
error can be kept alive by it. Emerson is an eminent
example of a man who never replied to attacks,
but went on his way, and saw at last all
opposition hushed, all hostility at an end. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
devoted his powers to giving to his readers his
insights, knowing that these alone feed the soul.
Thus men came to him to be fed. His sheep
heard his voice. Those who felt themselves better
for his instruction followed him. He collected
around him thus an ever-increasing band of disciples,
until in England, in Germany, in all lands
where men read and think, he is looked up to as a
master. Many of these disciples were persons of
rare gifts and powers, like Margaret Fuller, Theodore
Parker, George Ripley, Hawthorne. Many
others were unknown to fame, yet deeply sensible
of the blessings they had received from their prophet
and seer of the nineteenth century. For this
was his office. He was a man who saw. He had
the vision and the faculty divine. He sat near
the fountain-head, and tasted the waters of Helicon
in their source.</p>

<p>His first little book, a duodecimo of less than a
hundred pages, called "Nature," published in
1836, indicates all these qualities. It begins
<span class="locked">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Our age is retrospective. It builds the sepulchres
of the fathers. It writes biographies, histories,
criticisms. The foregoing generations beheld
God and Nature face to face; we, through
their eyes. Why should not we also enjoy an
original relation to the universe? Why should
not we have a poetry and philosophy of insight,
and not of tradition, and a religion by revelation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
to us, and not the history of theirs?... The sun
shines to-day also.... Undoubtedly we have no
questions to ask which are unanswerable."</p>

<p>This was his first doctrine, that of self-reliance.
He taught that God had given to every man the
power to see with his own eyes, think with his own
mind, believe what seemed to him true, plant himself
on his instincts, and, as he says, "call a pop-gun
a pop-gun, though the ancient and honorable
of the earth declare it to be the crack of doom."
This was manly and wholesome doctrine. It
might, no doubt, be abused, and lead some persons
to think they were men of original genius when
they were only eccentric. It may have led others
to attack all institutions and traditions, as though,
if a thing were old, it was necessarily false. But
Emerson himself was the best antidote to such
extravagance. To a youth who brought to him a
manuscript confuting Plato he replied, "When
you attack the king you ought to be sure to kill
him." But his protest against the prevailing conventionalism
was healthy, and his call on all "to
be themselves" was inspiring.</p>

<p>The same doctrine is taught in the introductory
remarks of the editors of the "Dial." They say
they have obeyed with joy the strong current of
thought which has led many sincere persons to
reprobate that rigor of conventions which is turning
them to stone, which renounces hope and only
looks backward, which suspects improvement, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
holds nothing so much in horror as the dreams of
youth. This work, the "Dial," made a great
impression, out of all proportion to its small circulation.
By the elders it was cordially declared
to be unintelligible mysticism, and so, no doubt,
much of it was. Those inside, its own friends,
often made as much fun of it as those outside.
Yet it opened the door for many new and noble
thoughts, and was a wild bugle-note, a reveillé,
calling on all generous hearts to look toward the
coming day.</p>

<p>Here is an extract from one of Emerson's letters
from Europe as early as March, 1833. It is dated
<span class="locked">Naples:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"And what if it be Naples! It is only the
same world of cakes and ale, of man, and truth,
and folly. I will not be imposed upon by a name.
It is so easy to be overawed by names that it is
hard to keep one's judgment upright, and be
pleased only after your own way. Baiæ and Pausilippo
sound so big that we are ready to surrender
at discretion, and not stickle for our private
opinion against what seems the human race. But
here's for the plain old Adam, the simple, genuine
self against the whole world."</p>

<p>Again he says: "Nothing so fatal to genius as
genius. Mr. Taylor, author of 'Van Artevelde,'
is a man of great intellect, but by study of Shakespeare
is forced to reproduce Shakespeare."</p>

<p>Thus the first great lesson taught by Mr. Emerson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
was "self-reliance." And the second was
like it, though apparently opposed to it, "God-reliance."
Not really opposed to it, for it meant
this: God is near to your mind and heart, as
he was to the mind and heart of the prophets
and inspired men of the past. God is ready to
inspire you also if you will trust in him. In the
little book called "Nature" he <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"The highest is present to the soul of man; the
dread universal essence, which is not wisdom, or
love, or power, or beauty, but all in one, and each
entirely, is that for which all things exist, and by
which they are. Believe that throughout nature
spirit is present; that it is one, that it does not
act upon us from without, but through ourselves....
As a plant on the earth, so man rests on the
bosom of God, nourished by unfailing fountains,
and drawing at his need inexhaustible power."</p>

<p>And so in his poem called "The Problem" he
teaches that all religions are from God; that all
the prophets and sibyls and lofty souls that have
sung psalms, written scripture, and built the temples
and cathedrals of men, were inspired by a
spirit above their own. He puts aside the shallow
explanation that any of the great religions ever
came from <span class="locked">priestcraft:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span></p><div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0q">"Out from the heart of Nature rolled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The burdens of the Bible old;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The litanies of nations came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the volcano's tongue of flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up from the burning core below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The canticles of love and woe.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Still floats upon the moving wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still whispers to the willing mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One accent of the Holy Ghost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heedless world hath never lost."<br /></span>
</div>
</div></div>

<p>In all that Emerson says of nature he is equally
devout. He sees God in it all. It is to him full
of a divine charm. "In the woods," he says, "is
perpetual youth. Within these plantations of God
a decorum and sanctity reigns, and we return to
reason and faith." "The currents of the Universal
Being circulate through me. I am part and
particle of God." For saying such things as these
he was accused of Pantheism. And he was a Pantheist;
yet only as Paul was a Pantheist when he
said, "In Him we live and move and have our
being;" "From whom and through whom are all
things;" "The fullness of him who filleth all in
all." Emerson was, in his view of nature, at one
with Wordsworth, who <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i6q">"The clouds were touched,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in their silent faces he could read<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unutterable love. Sensation, soul, and form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All melted into him; they swallowed up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His animal being; in them did he live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by them did he live; they were his life.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">In such high hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of visitation from the living God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thought was not; in enjoyment it expired."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Emerson has thus been to our day the prophet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
of God in the soul, in nature, in life. He has
stood for spirit against matter. Darwin, his great
peer, the serene master in the school of science,
was like him in this,&mdash;that he also said what he
saw and no more. He also taught what God
showed to him in the outward world of sense, as
Emerson what God showed in the inward world of
spirit. Amid the stormy disputes of their time,
each of these men went his own way, his eye single
and his whole body full of light. The work of
Darwin was the easier, for he floated with the
current of the time, which sets at present so strongly
toward the study of things seen and temporal.
But the work of Emerson was more noble, for he
stands for things unseen and eternal,&mdash;for a larger
religion, a higher faith, a nobler worship. This
strong and tender soul has done its work and gone
on its way. But he will always fill a niche of the
universal Church as a New England prophet. He
had the purity of the New England air in his moral
nature, a touch of the shrewd Yankee wit in his
speech, and the long inheritance of ancestral faith
incarnate and consolidated in blood and brain.
But to this were added qualities which were derived
from some far-off realm of human life: an
Oriental cast of thought, a touch of mediæval
mysticism, and a vocabulary brought from books
unknown to our New England literature. No
commonplaces of language are to be found in his
writings, and though he read the older writers, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
does not imitate them. He, also, like his humble-bee,
has gathered contributions from remotest fields,
and enriched our language with a new and picturesque
speech all his own.</p>

<p>Let us, then, be grateful for this best of God's
gifts,&mdash;another soul sent to us filled with divine
light. Thus we learn anew how full are nature
and life of <span class="locked">God:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"Ever fresh the broad creation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A divine improvisation;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the heart of God proceeds<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>One word concerning Mr. Emerson's relation to
Christ and to Christianity. The distinction which
he made between Jesus and other teachers was, no
doubt, one of degree and not one of kind. He put
no great gulf of supernatural powers, origin, or office
between Christ and the ethnic prophets. But
his reverence for Jesus was profound and tender.
Nor did he object to the word "Christian" or to
the Christian Church. In recent years, at least, he
not unfrequently attended the services of the Unitarian
Church in his town, and I have met him at
Unitarian conventions, a benign and revered presence.</p>

<p>In the cemetery at Bonn, on the Rhine, is the
tomb of Niebuhr, the historian, a man of somewhat
like type, as I judge, to our Emerson. At
least, some texts on his monument would be admirably
appropriate for any stone which may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
placed over the remains of the American prophet
and poet in the sweet valley of tombs in Concord.</p>

<p>One of these texts was from Sirach xlvii. 14, 17:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"How wise wast thou in thy youth, and as a flood filled with understanding!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy soul covered the whole earth, and thou filledst it with dark parables.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy name went far unto the islands, and for thy peace thou wast beloved.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The countries marvelled at thee for thy songs and proverbs and parables and interpretations."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">And equally appropriate would be this Horatian
line, also on Niebuhr's <span class="locked">monument:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus tam cari capitis."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From a lifelong friend of Emerson I have just
received a letter containing these words, which,
better than most descriptions, give the character of
his <span class="locked">soul:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"And so the white wings have spread, and the
great soul has left us.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0">'’Tis death is dead; not he.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">He had no vanity, no selfishness; no greed, no
hate; none of the weights that drag on common
mortals. His life was an illumination; a large,
fair light; the Pharos of New England, as in other
days our dear brother called him. And this light
shone further and wider the longer it burned."</p>

<h2 title="HARRIET MARTINEAU"><a id="HARRIET">HARRIET MARTINEAU</a><a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></h2>

<p>The whole <span class="locked">work<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span> is very interesting. How could
it be otherwise, in giving the history of so remarkable
a life? The amount of literary work which
Miss Martineau performed is amazing. She began
to write for the press when she was nineteen, and
continued until she could no longer hold her pen.
The pen was her sword, which she wielded with a
warrior's joy, in the conflict of truth with error, of
right with wrong. She wrote many books; but
her articles in reviews and newspapers were innumerable.
We find no attempt in either part of this
biography to give a complete list of her writings.
Perhaps it would be impossible. She never seems
to have thought of keeping such a record herself,
any more than a hero records the number of the
blows he strikes, in battle. No sooner had she dismissed
one task than another came; and sometimes
several were going on together. Like other voluminous
writers, she enjoyed the exercise of her productive
powers; and, as she somewhere tells us, her
happiest hours were those in which she was seated
at her desk with her pen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span></p>
<p>Her principal works cover a large range of
thought and study. One of her first books, "The
Traditions of Palestine," she continued to regard
long after with more affection than any other of
her writings, except "Eastern Life." But her
authorship began when she was nineteen, in an article
contributed to a Unitarian monthly. Afterwards
she obtained three separate prizes offered by
the Central Unitarian Association for three essays
on different topics. About the same time she wrote
"Five Years of Youth," a tale which she never
looked at afterward. But her first great step in
authorship, and that which at once made her a
power in politics and in literature, was taken when
she commenced her series of tales on "Political
Economy." She began, however, to write these
stories, not knowing that she was treating questions
of Political Economy, "the very name of which,"
she says, "was then either unknown to me, or conveyed
no meaning." She was then about twenty-five
years old. She had the usual difficulties with
various publishers which unknown authors are sure
to experience, and these tales, which became so
popular, were rejected by one firm after another.
One of them was refused by the Society for the
Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, as being too dull.
The president of that Society, Lord Brougham,
afterward vented his rage on the sub-committee
which rejected the offered story, and so had permitted
their Society, "instituted for that very purpose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
to be driven out of the field by a little deaf
woman at Norwich." At last a publisher was
found who agreed to take the books on very unsatisfactory
terms. As soon as the first number
appeared, the success of the series was established.
A second edition of five thousand copies was immediately
called for,&mdash;the entire periodical press
came out in favor of the tales,&mdash;and from that
hour Miss Martineau had only to choose what to
write, sure that it would at once find a publisher.</p>

<p>She was at this time thirty years old. She was
already deaf, her health poor; but she then began
a career of intellectual labor seldom equaled by
the strongest man through the longest life. She
began to write every morning after breakfast; and,
unless when traveling, seldom passed a morning
during the rest of her life without writing,&mdash;working
from eight o'clock until two. Her method
was, after selecting her subject, to procure all the
standard works upon it, and study them. She then
proceeded to make the plan of her work, and to
draw the outline of her story. If the scene was
laid abroad, she procured books of travels and
topography. Then she drew up the contents of
each chapter in detail, and, after this preliminary
labor, the story was written easily and with joy.</p>

<p>Of these stories she wrote thirty-four in two
years and a half. She was then thirty-two. She
received £2,000 for the whole series,&mdash;a sufficiently
small compensation,&mdash;but she established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
her position and her fame. Her principal books published
afterward were her two works on America,
the novels "Deerbrook" and "The Hour and the
Man;" nine volumes of tales on the Forest and
Game Laws; four stories in the "Playfellow;"
"Life in the Sick-Room;" "Letters on Mesmerism;"
"Eastern Life, Past and Present;" "History
of England during the Thirty Years' Peace;"
"Letters on the Laws of Man's Social Nature and
Development;" "Translation and Condensation
of Comte's Positive Philosophy;" besides many
smaller works, making fifty-two titles in Allibone.
In addition to this, she wrote many articles in reviews
and magazines; and Mrs. Chapman mentions
that she sent to a single London journal, the
"Daily News," sixteen hundred articles, at the rate
sometimes of six a week. Surely Harriet Martineau
was one who worked faithfully while her day
endured.</p>

<p>But, if we would do her justice, we must consider
also the motive and spirit in which she
worked. Each thing she did had for its purpose
nothing merely personal, but some good to mankind.
Though there was nothing in her character
of the sentimentalism of philanthropy, she was
filled with the spirit of philanthropy. A born reformer,
she inherited from her Huguenot and her
Unitarian ancestors the love of truth and the hatred
of error, with the courage which was ready to avow
her opinions, however unpopular. Thus, her work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
was warfare, and every article or book which she
printed was a blow delivered against some flagrant
wrong, or what she believed such,&mdash;in defense of
some struggling truth, or something supposed to be
truth. She might be mistaken; but her purposes
through life were, in the main, noble, generous, and
good.</p>

<p>And there can be no question of her ability,
moral and intellectual. No commonplace mind
could have overcome such obstacles and achieved
such results. Apparently she had no very high
opinion of her own intellectual powers. She denies
that she possesses genius; but she asserts her own
power. She criticises "Deerbrook" with some
severity. And, in fact, Harriet Martineau's mind
is analytic rather than creative; it is strong rather
than subtle; and, if it possesses imagination, it is
of rather a prosaic kind. Her intellect is of a
curiously masculine order; no other female writer
was ever less feminine. With all her broad humanity
she has little sympathy for individuals. A
large majority of those whom she mentions in her
memoirs she treats with a certain contempt.</p>

<p>Her early life seems to have been very sad. We
are again and again told how she was misunderstood
and maltreated in her own home. Her health
was bad until she was thirty; partly owing, as she
supposed, to ill-treatment. She needed affection,
and was treated with sternness. Justice she did
not receive, nor kindness, and her heart was soured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
and her temper spoiled, so she tells us, by this mismanagement.
As she does not specify, or give us
the details of this ill-treatment, the story is useless
as a warning; and we hardly see the reason for
thus publishing the wrongs of her childhood. As
children may be sometimes unjust to parents, no
less than parents to children, the facts and the
moral are both left uncertain. And, on the whole,
her chief reason for telling the story appears to be
the mental necessity she was under of judging and
sentencing those from whom she supposes herself
to have received ill-treatment in any part of her
life.</p>

<p>This is indeed the most painful feature of the
work before us. Knowing the essentially generous
and just spirit of Harriet Martineau, it is strange
to see how carefully she has loaded this piece of
artillery with explosive and lacerating missiles,
to be discharged after her death among those with
whom she had mingled in social intercourse or literary
labors. Some against whom she launches
her sarcasms are still living; some are dead, but
have left friends behind, to be wounded by her
caustic judgments. Is it that her deficiency in a
woman's sensibility, or the absence of a poetic
imagination, prevented her from realizing the suffering
she would inflict? Or is it the habit of mind
from which those are apt to suffer who devote themselves
to the reform of abuses? As each kind of
manual occupation exposes the workman to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
special disease,&mdash;as those who dig canals suffer
from malaria, and file-grinders from maladies of
the lungs,&mdash;so it seems that each moral occupation
has its appropriate moral danger. Clergymen are
apt to be dogmatic or sectarian; lawyers become
sharp and sophistical; musicians and artists are
irritable; and the danger of a reformer is of becoming
a censorious critic of those who cannot accept
his methods, or who will not join his party.
That Harriet Martineau did not escape this risk
will presently appear.</p>

<p>While writing her politico-economical stories she
moved to London, and there exchanged the quiet
seclusion of her Norwich life for social triumphs of
the first order, and intercourse with every kind of
celebrity. All had read her books, from Victoria,
who was then a little girl perusing them with her
governess, to foreign kings and savants of the highest
distinction. So this young author&mdash;for she was
only thirty&mdash;was received at once into the most
brilliant circles of London society. But it does not
appear that she lost a single particle of her dignity
or self-possession. Among the great she neither
asserted herself too much nor showed too much deference.
Vanity was not her foible; and her head
was too solidly set upon her shoulders to be turned
by such successes. She enjoyed the society of these
people of superior refinement, rank, and culture,
but did not come to depend upon it; and in all this
Harriet Martineau sinned not in her spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
But why, in writing about these people long
afterward, should she have thought it necessary to
produce such sharp and absolute sentences on each
and all? Into this judgment-hall of Osiris-Martineau,
every one whom she has ever known is called
up to receive his final doom. The poor Unitarian
ministers, who had taught the child as they best
could, are dismissed with contemptuous severity.
This religious instruction had certainly done her
some good. Religion, she admits, was her best
resource till she wrought her way to something
better. Ann Turner, daughter of the Unitarian
minister, gave her piety a practical turn, and when
afraid of every one she saw, she was not at all
afraid of God; and, on the whole, she says religion
was a great comfort and pleasure to her. Nevertheless,
she is astonished that Unitarians should
believe that they are giving their children a Christian
education. She accuses these teachers of her
childhood of altering the Scripture to suit their
own notions; being apparently ignorant that most
of the interpolations or mistranslations of which
they complained have since been conceded as such
by the best Orthodox critics. But she does not
hesitate to give her opinion of all her old acquaintances
in the frankest manner, and for the most
part it is unfavorable. Mrs. Opie and Mrs. John
Taylor are among the "mere pedants." William
Taylor, from want of truth and conviction, talked
blasphemy. She speaks with contempt of a physician<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
who politely urged her to come and dine with
him, because he had neglected her until she became
famous. Lord Brougham was "vain and selfish,
low in morals, and unrestrained in temper." Lord
Campbell was "flattering to an insulting degree;"
Archbishop Whately, "odd and overbearing,"
"sometimes rude and tiresome," and "singularly
overrated;" Stanley, Bishop of Norwich, "timid,"
"sensitive," "heedless," "without courage or dignity."
Macaulay "talked nonsense" about the
copyright bill, and "set at naught every principle
of justice in regard to authors' earnings." Macaulay's
opposition to that bill was based on such
grounds of perfect justice that he defeated it single-handed.
But Harriet Martineau decided then
and there that Macaulay was a failure, and that
"he wanted heart," and that he "never has
achieved any complete success." The poet Campbell
had "a morbid craving for praise." As to
women, Lady Morgan, Lady Davy, Mrs. Jameson,
Mrs. Austin, "may make women blush and men
be insolent" with their "gross and palpable vanities."
Landseer was a toady to great people.
Morpeth had "evident weaknesses." Sir Charles
Bell showed his ignorance by relying on the argument
for Design. The resources of Eastlake were
very <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bornés</i>. John Sterling "rudely ignored me."
Lady Mary Shepherd was "a pedant." Coleridge,
she asserts, will only be remembered as a warning;
though twenty years ago she, Miss Martineau,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
"regarded him as a poet." Godwin was "timid."
Basil Montagu was "cowardly;" and Lord Monteagle
"agreeable enough to those who were not
particular about sincerity." Urquhart had "insane
egotism and ferocious discontent." The
Howitts made "an unintelligible claim to my
friendship," their "tempers are turbulent and
unreasonable." It may be some explanation of
this unintelligible claim that it was heard through
her trumpet. Fredrika Bremer is accused of habits
of "flattery" and "a want of common sense."
Miss Mitford is praised, but then accused of a
"habit of flattery," and blamed for her "disparagement
of others." And it is Miss Martineau
who brings this charge! She also tells us that
Miss Bremer "proposes to reform the world by a
floating religiosity," whatever that may be. But
perhaps her severest sentence is pronounced on the
Kembles, who are accused of "incurable vulgarity"
and "unreality." In this case, as in others, Miss
Martineau pronounces this public censure on those
whom she had learned to know in the intimacy of
private friendship and personal confidence. She
thus violates the rules rather ostentatiously laid
down in her Introduction. For she claims there
that she practices self-denial in interdicting the
publication of her <span class="locked">letters,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span> and gives her reasons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
thus: "Epistolary conversation is written speech;
and the <em>onus</em> rests with those who publish it to
show why the laws of honor, which are uncontested
in regard to conversation, may be violated when
the conversation is written instead of spoken."
Most of her sharp judgments above quoted are
pronounced on those whom she learned to know
in the private intercourse of society. Sometimes
she recites the substance of what she heard (or
supposed that she heard; for she used an ear-tube
when she first went to live in London). Thus she
tells about a conversation with Wordsworth, and
reports his complaints of Jeffrey and other reviewers,
and quotes him as saying about one of his
own poems, that it was "a chain of very <em>valooable</em>
thoughts." "You see, it does not best fulfill the
conditions of poetry; but it is" (solemnly) "a
chain of extremely valooable thoughts." She then
proceeds to pronounce her sentence on Wordsworth
as she did on Coleridge. She felt at once, she
says, in Wordsworth's works, "the absence of
sound, accurate, weighty thought, and of genuine
poetic inspiration." She also informs us that "the
very basis of philosophy is absent in him," and
that it is only necessary "to open Shelley, Tennyson,
or even poor Keats ... to feel that, with all
their truth and all their charm, few of Wordsworth's
pieces are poems." "<em>Even poor Keats!</em>"
This is her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">de haut en bas</i> style of criticism
on Wordsworth, one of whose poems is generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
accepted as the finest written in the English language
during the last hundred years. And this is
her way of respecting "the code of honor" in regard
to private conversation!</p>

<p>In 1834, at the age of thirty-two, Harriet Martineau
sailed for the United States, where she remained
two years. She went for rest; but the
quantity of work done in those two years would
have been enough to fill five or six years of any
common life. At this point she began a new career;
forming new ties, engaging in new duties,
studying new problems, and beginning a new activity
in another sphere of labor. The same great
qualities which she had hitherto displayed showed
themselves here again; accompanied with their
corresponding defects. Her wonderful power of
study enabled her to enter into the very midst of
the phenomena of American life; her noble generosity
induced her to throw herself heart, hand, and
mind into the greatest struggle then waging on the
face of the earth. The antislavery question, which
the great majority of people of culture despised
or disliked, took possession of her soul. She became
one of the party of Abolitionists, of which
Mr. Garrison was the chief, and lived to see that
party triumph in the downfall of slavery. She
took her share of the hatred or the scorn heaped
on that fiery body of zealous propagandists, and
was counted worthy of belonging to what she herself
called "the Martyr Age of the United States."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
Fortunately for herself, before she visited Boston,
and became acquainted with the Abolitionists,
she went to Washington, and traveled somewhat
extensively in the Southern States. At Washington
she saw many eminent Southern senators, who
cordially invited her to visit them at their homes.
In South Carolina she was welcomed or introduced
by Mr. Calhoun, Governor Hayne, and Colonel
Preston. Judge Porter took charge of her in
Louisiana. In Kentucky she was the guest of
Mrs. Irwin, Henry Clay's daughter and neighbor.
Without fully accepting Mrs. Chapman's somewhat
sweeping assertion that there was no eminent
statesman, man of science, politician, partisan,
philanthropist, jurist, professor, merchant, divine,
nor distinguished woman, in the whole land, who
did not pay her homage, there is no doubt that she
received the respect and good-will of many such.
She was deeply impressed, she says, on arriving in
the United States, with a society basking in one
bright sunshine of good-will. She thought the New
Englanders, perhaps, the best people in the world.
Many well-known names appear in these pages, as
soon becoming intimate acquaintances or friends;
among these were Judge Story, John G. Palfrey,
Stephen C. Phillips, the Gilmans of South
Carolina, Mr. and Mrs. Furness of Philadelphia,
and in Massachusetts the Sedgwicks, the Follens,
Mr. and Mrs. Ellis Gray Loring, Mr. and Mrs.
Charles G. Loring, Dr. Channing, Mr. and Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
Henry Ware, Dr. Flint of Salem, and Ephraim
Peabody.</p>

<p>When Miss Martineau had identified herself
with Mr. Garrison and his friends by taking part
in their meetings, those who had merely sought
her on account of her position and reputation naturally
fell away. But it may be doubted whether
she was in such danger of being mobbed or murdered
as she and her editor suppose. She seems
to think that Mr. Henry Ware did a very brave
deed in driving to Mr. Francis Jackson's house to
take her home from an antislavery meeting. She
speaks of the reign of terror which existed in Boston
at that time. No doubt she, and other Abolitionists,
had their share of abuse; but it is not
probable that any persons were, as she thought,
plotting against her life. She and her friends
were deterred from taking a proposed journey to
Cincinnati and Louisville by being informed that
it was intended to mob her in the first city and
to hang her in the second. Now, the writer of this
article was at that time residing in Louisville, and
though antislavery discussions and antislavery lectures
had taken place there about that period, and
though antislavery articles not unfrequently appeared
in the city journals, no objection or opposition
was made to all this by anybody in that place.
In fact, it was easier at that time to speak against
slavery in Louisville than in Boston. The leading
people in Kentucky of all parties were then openly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
opposed to slavery, and declared their hope and
purpose of making Kentucky a free State. A year
later, Dr. Channing published his work on slavery,
which was denounced for its abolitionism by
the "Boston Statesman," and sharply criticised in
a pamphlet by the Massachusetts attorney-general.
But copious extracts from this work, especially of
the parts which exposed the sophisms of the defenders
of slavery, were published in a Louisville
magazine, and not the least objection was made
to it in that city. At a later period it might have
been different, though an antislavery paper was
published in Louisville as late as 1845, one of the
editors being a native Kentuckian.</p>

<p>After her return from the United States she
published her two works, "Society in America,"
and "Retrospect of Western Travel;" and then
wrote her first novel, "Deerbrook." The books
on America were perhaps the best then written by
any foreigner except De Tocqueville. They were
generous, honest, kind, and utterly frank,&mdash;they
were full of capital descriptions of American
scenery. She spoke the truth to us, and she
spoke it in love. The chief fault in these works
was her tone of dogmatism, and her <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex cathedrâ</i>
judgments; which, as we have before hinted, are
among the defects of her qualities.</p>

<p>In 1838, when thirty-six years old, she was
taken with serious illness, which confined her to
her room for six years. She attributes this illness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
to her anxiety about her aged aunt and mother.
Her mother, she tells us, was irritable on account
of Miss Martineau's fame and position in society;
in short, she was jealous of her daughter's success.
Miss Martineau was obliged to sit up late after
midnight to mend her own clothes, as she was not
allowed to have a maid or to hire a working-woman,
even at her own expense. How she could
have been prevented is difficult to see, especially as
she was the money-making member of the family.
It seems hardly worth while to give us this glimpse
into domestic difficulties. But, no doubt, she is
quite correct in adding, as another reason for her
illness, the toils which were breaking her down.
The strongest men could hardly bear such a strain
on the nervous system without giving way.</p>

<p>And here comes in the important episode of Mr.
Atkinson, mesmerism, and the New Philosophy.
She believes that she was cured of a disease, pronounced
incurable by the regular physicians, by
mesmerism. By this she means the influence exerted
upon her by certain manipulations from
another person. And as long as we are confessedly
so ignorant of nervous diseases, there
seems no reason to question the facts to which
Miss Martineau testifies. She was, there is little
doubt, cured by these manipulations; what the
power was which wrought through them remains
to be ascertained.</p>

<p>In regard to Mr. Atkinson and his philosophy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
accepted by her with such satisfaction, and which
henceforth became the master-light of all her seeing,
our allotted space will allow us only to speak
very briefly. The results of this new mental departure
could not but disturb and afflict many of
her friends, to whom faith in God, Christ, and
immortality was still dear. To Miss Martineau
herself, however, her disbelief in these seemed a
happy emancipation. She carried into the assertion
of her new and unpopular ideas the same
honesty and courage she had always shown, and
also the same superb dogmatism and contempt for
those who differed from her. Apparently it was
always to her an absolute impossibility to imagine
herself wrong when she had once come to a conclusion.
In theory she might conceive it possible
to be mistaken, but practically she felt herself
infallible. The following examples will show how
she speaks, throughout her biography, of those
who held the opinions she had rejected.</p>

<p>Miss Martineau, being a Necessarian, says,
"All the best minds I know are Necessarians; all,
indeed, who are qualified to discuss the subject at
all." "The very smallest amount of science is
enough to enable any rational being to see that
the constitution and action of will are determined
by the influences beyond the control of the possessor
of the faculty." She adds, that for more than
thirty years she has seen how awful "are the evils
which arise from that monstrous remnant of old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
superstition,&mdash;the supposition of a self-determining
power, etc." Now, among those she had
intimately known were Dr. Channing and James
Martineau, neither of them believing in the doctrine
of Necessity.</p>

<p>Speaking of Christianity, after she had rejected
it, she calls it "a monstrous superstition." Elsewhere
she speaks of "the Christian superstition of
the contemptible nature of the body;" says that
"Christians deprave their moral sense;" talks of
"the selfish complacencies of religion," and of
"the atmosphere of selfishness which is the very
life of Christian doctrine and of every other theological
scheme;" speaks of "the Christian mythology
as a superstition which fails to make happy,
fails to make good, fails to make wise, and has become
as great an obstacle in the way of progress
as the prior mythologies it took the place of."
"For three centuries it has been undermined, and
its overthrow completely decided." Thus easily
does she settle the question of Christianity.</p>

<p>Miss Martineau ceased to believe in immortality;
and immediately all believers in immortality
became, to her mind, selfish or stupid, or both.
"I neither wish to live longer here," she says,
"nor to find life again elsewhere. It seems to me
simply absurd to expect it, and a mere act of
restricted human imagination and morality to conceive
of it." There is "a total absence of evidence
for a renewed life." "I myself utterly disbelieve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
in a future life." She would submit,
though reluctantly, to live again, if compelled to.
"If I find myself conscious after the lapse of life,
it will be all right, of course; but, as I said, the
supposition appears to me absurd."</p>

<p>Under the instructions of Mr. Atkinson, Miss
Martineau ceased to believe in a personal God, or
any God but an unknown First Cause, identical
with the Universe. The argument for Design, on
which Mr. John Stuart Mill, for instance, lays
such stress, seemed to her "puerile and unphilosophical."
The God of Christians she calls an
"invisible idol." He "who does justice to his
own faculties" must give up "the personality of
the First Cause." She considered the religion in
her "Life in the Sick-Room" to have been "insincere;"
which we, who know the perfect honesty
of Harriet Martineau, must take the liberty to
deny. Though declaring herself to be no Atheist,
because she believes in an unknown and unknowable
First Cause, she regards philosophical Atheists
as the best people she had ever known, and
was delighted in finding herself unacquainted with
God, and so at peace.</p>

<p>It is curious to read these "Letters on the Laws
of Man's Nature and Development," of which
Harriet Martineau and Mr. Atkinson are the joint
authors. The simple joy with which they declare
themselves the proud discoverers of this happy
land of the unknowable is almost touching. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
that we know, say they, is matter or its manifestation.
"Mind is the product of the brain," and
"the brain is not, as even some phrenologists have
asserted, the instrument of the mind." The brain
is the source of consciousness, will, reason. Man
is "a creature of necessity." "It seems certain
that mind, or the conditions essential to mind, is
evolved from gray vesicular matter." "Nothing
in nature indicates a future life." "Knowledge
recognizes that nothing can be free, or by chance;
no, not even God,&mdash;God is the substance of
Law." Whereupon Miss Martineau inquires
whether Mr. Atkinson, in speaking of God, did
not merely use another name for Law. "We
know nothing beyond law, do we?" asks this
meek disciple, seeking for information. Mr. Atkinson
replies that we must assume some fundamental
principle "as a thing essential, though
unknown; and it is this which I wrongly enough
perhaps termed God." But if it is wrong to call
this principle God, and if they know nothing else
behind phenomena, why do they complain so bitterly
at being charged with Atheism? And directly
Mr. Atkinson asserts that "Philosophy
finds no God in nature; no personal being or
creator, nor sees the want of any." "A Creator
after the likeness of man" he affirms to be "an
impossibility." For, though he professes to know
<em>nothing</em> about God, he somehow contrives to know
that God is <em>not</em> what others believe him to be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
Eternal sleep after death he professes to be the
only hope of a wise man. The idea of free-will is
so absurd that it "would make a Democritus fall
on his back and roar with laughter." "Christianity
is neither reasonable nor moral." Miss
Martineau responds that "deep and sweet" is her
repose in the conviction that "there is no theory
of God, of an author of Nature, of an origin of the
Universe, which is not utterly repugnant to my
faculties; which is not (to my feelings) so irreverent
as to make me blush, so misleading as to
make me mourn." And thus do the apostle and
the disciple go on, triumphantly proclaiming their
own limitations to the end of the volume.</p>

<p>And yet the effect of this book is by no means
wholly disagreeable. To be sure, in their constant
assertions of the "impossibility" of any belief but
their own being true, their honest narrowness may
often be a little amusing. They seem like two eyeless
fish in the recesses of the darkness of the Mammoth
Cave talking to each other of the absurdity
of believing in any sun or upper world. But they
are so honest, so sincere, so much in love with
Truth, and so free from any self-seeking, that we
find it easy to sympathize with their naïve sense of
discovery, as they go sounding on their dim and
perilous way. Only we cannot but think what a
disappointment it must be to Harriet Martineau
to find herself alive again in the other world. In
her case, as Mr. Wentworth Higginson acutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
remarks, we are deprived of the pleasure of sympathizing
with her gladness at discovering her
mistake, since another life will be to her a disagreeable
as well as an unforeseen event.</p>

<p>Nor is it extraordinary, to those who trace
Harriet Martineau's intellectual history, that she
should have fallen into these melancholy conclusions.
In her childhood and youth, most of the
Unitarians of England, followers of Priestley,
adopted his philosophy of materialism and necessity.
Priestley did not believe in a soul, but
trusted for a future life to the resurrection of the
body. He was also a firm believer in philosophical
necessity. An active and logical mind like
Miss Martineau's, destitute of the keenness and
profundity which belonged to that of her brother
James, might very naturally arrive at a disbelief
in anything but matter and its phenomena. From
ignorance of these facts, Mrs. Chapman expresses
surprise that the inconsistency of Harriet Martineau's
belief in necessity, with other parts of her
Unitarianism, "should not have struck herself, her
judges, or the denomination at large." It <em>would</em>
have been inconsistent with American Unitarianism,
but it was not foreign from the views of English
Unitarians at that time.</p>

<p>The publication of these "Letters" naturally
caused pain to religious people, and especially to
those of them who had known and honored Miss
Martineau for her many past services in the cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
of human freedom and progress. Many of these
were Unitarians and Unitarian ministers, who had
been long proud of her as a member of their denomination
and one of their most valued co-workers.
It seemed necessary for them to declare their
dissent from her new views, and this dissent was
expressed in an article in the "Prospective Review,"
written by her own brother, James Martineau.
Mrs. Chapman now makes known, what has
hitherto been only a matter of conjecture, that this
review gave such serious offense to Miss Martineau
that she from that time refused to recognize
her brother or to have any further communication
with him. Mrs. Chapman, who seldom or never
finds her heroine in the wrong, justifies and approves
her conduct also here, quoting a passage
from the review in support of Miss Martineau's
conduct in treating her brother as one of "the
defamers of old times whom she must never again
meet." In this passage Mr. Martineau only expresses
his profound grief that his sister should sit
at the feet of such a master as Mr. Atkinson, and
lay down at his bidding her early faith in moral
obligation, in the living God, in the immortal
sanctities. He calls this "an inversion of the
natural order of nobleness," implying that Mr.
Atkinson ought to have sat at her feet instead;
and, turning to the review itself, we find this the
only passage in which a single word is said which
could be regarded as a censure on Miss Martineau.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
But Mr. Atkinson is indeed handled with some
severity. His language is criticised, and his logic
is proved fallacious. Much the largest part of the
review is, however, devoted to a refutation of his
philosophy and doctrines. Now, as so large a part
of the "Letters" is pervaded with denunciations
of the bigotry which will not hear the other side of
a question, and filled with admiration of those who
prefer truth to the ties of kindred, friendship, and
old association, we should have thought that Miss
Martineau would rejoice in having a brother who
could say, "Amica Harriet, sed magis amica veritas."
Not at all. It was evident that he had said
nothing about herself at which she could take
offense; but in speaking against her new philosophy
and her new philosopher he had committed
the unpardonable sin. And Mrs. Chapman allows
herself to regard it as a natural inference that
this honest and manly review resulted from "masculine
terror, fraternal jealousy of superiority, with
a sectarian and provincial impulse to pull down
and crush a world-wide celebrity." She considers
it "incomprehensible in an advocate of free
thought" that he should express his thoughts
freely in opposition to a book which argued
against all possible knowledge of God and against
all faith in a future life. It is, however, only just
to Miss Martineau to say that she herself has
brought no such charges against her brother, but
left the matter in silence. We cannot but think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
that it would have been better for Miss Martineau's
reputation if her biographer had followed
her example.</p>

<p>But, though we must object to Mrs. Chapman's
views on this point, and on some others, we must
add that her part of the second volume is prepared
with much ability, and is evidently the result of
diligent and loyal friendship. Miss Martineau
could not have selected a more faithful friend to
whom to confide the history of her life. On two
subjects, however, we are obliged to dissent from
her statements. One is in regard to Dr. Channing,
whom she, for some unknown reason, systematically
disparages. He was a good man, Mrs.
Chapman admits, "but not in any sense a great
one. With benevolent intentions, he could not
greatly help the nineteenth century, for he knew
very little about it, or, indeed, of any other. He
had neither insight, courage, nor firmness. In his
own Church had sprung up a vigorous opposition
to slavery, which he innocently, in so far as ignorantly,
used the little strength he had to stay."
Certainly it is not necessary to defend the memory
of Dr. Channing against such a supercilious judgment
as this. But we might well ask why, if he is
not a great man, and did not help the nineteenth
century, his works should continue to be circulated
all over Europe? Why should such men in
France as Laboulaye and Rémusat occupy themselves
in translating and diffusing them? Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
should Bunsen class him among the five prophets
of the Divine Consciousness in Human History,&mdash;speaking
of "his fearless speech," his "unfailing
good sense," and "his grandeur of soul, which
makes him a prophet of the Christianity of the
Future"? Bunsen calls him a Greek in his
manly nature, a Roman in his civic qualities, and
an apostle in his Christianity. And was that man
deficient in courage or firmness who never faltered
in the support of any opinions, however unpopular,
whether it was to defend Unitarianism in its
weak beginnings, to appear in Faneuil Hall as
the leader against the defenders of the Alton mob,
to head the petition for the pardon of Abner
Kneeland, and to lay on the altar of antislavery
the fame acquired by past labors? Is he to be
accused of repressing the antislavery movement
in his own church, when there is on record the
letter in which he advocated giving the use of the
church building to the society represented by Mrs.
Chapman herself; and when the men of influence
in his society refused it? Nor, in those days of
their unpopularity, did Mrs. Chapman and her
friends count Dr. Channing's aid so insignificant.
In her article on "The Martyr Age," Miss Martineau
describes the profound impression caused by
Dr. Channing's sudden appearance in the State
House to give his countenance and aid to Garrison
and the Abolitionists, in what, she says, was a
matter to them of life and death. And she adds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
"He was thenceforth considered by the world an
accession to their principles, though not to their
organized body."</p>

<p>Nor do we quite understand Mrs. Chapman's
giving to Miss Martineau the credit of being the
cause of the petition for the pardon of Abner
Kneeland; as his conviction, and the consequent
petition, did not take place until she had been
nearly two years out of the country. And why
does Mrs. Chapman select for special contempt, as
unfaithful to their duty to mankind, the Unitarian
ministers? Why does she speak of "the cowardly
ranks of American Unitarians" with such peculiar
emphasis? It is not our business here to defend
this denomination; but we cannot but recall the
"Protest against American Slavery" prepared and
signed in 1845 by one hundred and seventy-three
Unitarian ministers, out of a body containing not
more than two hundred and fifty in all. And it
was this body which furnished to the cause some
of its most honored members. Of those who have
belonged to the Unitarian body, we now recall the
names of such persons as Samuel J. May, Samuel
May, Josiah Quincy, John Quincy Adams, John
Pierpont, Mr. and Mrs. Ellis Gray Loring, John
G. Palfrey, John P. Hale, Dr. and Mrs. Follen,
Theodore Parker, John Parkman, John T. Sargent,
James Russell Lowell, Wm. H. Furness,
Charles Sumner, Caleb Stetson, John A. Andrew,
Lydia Maria Child, Dr. S.&nbsp;G. Howe, Horace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
Mann, T.&nbsp;W. Higginson. So much for the "cowardly
ranks of American Unitarians."</p>

<p>The last years of Miss Martineau were happy
and peaceful. She had a pleasant home at Ambleside,
on Lake Windermere. She had many
friends, was conscious of having done a good work,
and if she had no hopes in the hereafter, neither
had she any fears concerning it. She was a
strong, upright, true-hearted woman; one of those
who have helped to vindicate "the right of women
to learn the alphabet."</p>

<h2 title="THE RISE AND FALL OF THE SLAVE POWER IN AMERICA"><a id="RISE">THE RISE AND FALL OF THE SLAVE POWER IN AMERICA</a><a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></h2>

<p>On the first day of January, 1832, when the
American Antislavery Society was formed in the
office of Samuel E. Sewall in Boston, the abolition
of slavery through any such agency seemed impossible.
Almost all the great interests of the country
were combined to defend and sustain the system.
The capital invested in slaves amounted to at least
one thousand millions of dollars. This vast pecuniary
interest was rapidly increasing by the growing
demand for the cotton crop of the Southern States&mdash;a
demand which continually overlapped the supply.
The whole political power of the thirteen
slave States was in the hands of the slaveholders.
No white man in the South, unless he was a slaveholder,
was ever elected to Congress, or to any important
political position at home. The two great
parties, Whig and Democrat, were pledged to the
support of slavery in all its constitutional rights,
and vied with each other in giving to these the
largest interpretation. By a constitutional provision,
which could not be altered, the slave States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
had in Congress, in 1840, twenty-five more Representatives
in proportion to their number of voters
than the free States. By the cohesion of this great
political and pecuniary interest the slaveholders,
though comparatively few in number, were able to
govern the nation. The Presidents, both houses of
Congress, the Supreme Court of the United States,
the two great political parties, the press of the
country, the mercantile interest, and that mysterious
force which we call society, were virtually in
the hands of the slaveholders. Whenever their
privileges were attacked, all these powers rallied
to their defense. Public opinion, in the highest
circles of society and in the lowest, was perfectly
agreed on this one question. The saloons of the
Fifth Avenue and the mob of the Five Points were
equally loyal to the sacred cause of slavery. Thus
all the great powers which control free states were
combined for its defense; and the attempt to assail
this institution might justly be regarded as
madness. In fact, all danger seemed so remote,
that even so late as 1840 it was common for slaveholders
to admit that property in man was an absurdity
and an injustice. The system itself was so
secure, that they could afford to concede its principle
to their opponents. Just as men formerly
fought duels as a matter of course, while frankly
admitting that it was wrong to do so,&mdash;just as at
the present time we concede that war is absurd and
unchristian, but yet go to war continually, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
we know no other way of settling international disputes,&mdash;so
the slaveholders used to say, "Slavery
is wrong; we know that: but how is it to be abolished?
What can we do about it?"</p>

<p>Such was the state of things in the United States
less than half a century ago. On one side was an
enormous pecuniary interest, vast political power,
the weight of the press, an almost unanimous public
opinion, the necessities of commerce, the authority
of fashion, the teachings of nearly every
denomination in the Christian church, and the
moral obligations attributed to the sacred covenants
of the fathers of the Republic. On the other
side there were only a few voices crying in the wilderness,
"It is unjust to claim property in man."
The object of the work before us is to show how,
after the slave power had reached this summit of
influence, it lost it all in a single generation; how,
less by the zeal of its opponents than by the madness
of its defenders, this enormous fabric of oppression
was undermined and overthrown; and
how, in a few years, the insignificant handful of
antislavery people brought to their side the great
majority of the nation.</p>

<p>Certainly a work which should do justice to such
a history would be one of the most interesting
books ever written. For in this series of events
everything was involved which touches most nearly
the mind, the conscience, the imagination, and the
heart of man. How many radical problems in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
statesmanship, in political economy, in ethics, in
philosophy, in theology, in history, in science, came
up for discussion during this long controversy!
What pathetic stories of suffering, what separation
of families, what tales of torture, what cruelty
grown into a custom, what awful depths of misery,
came continually to light, as though the judgment-day
were beginning to dawn on the dark places of
the earth! What romances of adventure, what
stories of courage and endurance, of ingenuity in
contrivance, of determination of soul, were listened
to by breathless audiences as related by the humble
lips of the fugitives from bondage! How trite
and meagre became all the commonplaces of oratory
before the flaming eloquence of these terrible
facts! How tame grew all the conventional
rhetoric of pulpit and platform, by the side of
speech vitalized by the immediate presence of this
majestic argument! The book which should reproduce
the antislavery history of those thirty years
would possess an unimagined charm.</p>

<p>We cannot say that Mr. Wilson's volumes do all
this, nor had we any right to expect it. He proposes
to himself nothing of the sort. What he
gives us is, however, of very great value. It is a
very carefully collected, clearly arranged, and accurate
account of the rise and progress, decline and
catastrophe, of slavery in the United States. Mr.
Wilson does not attempt to be philosophical like
Bancroft and Draper; nor are his pages as picturesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
as are those of Motley and Carlyle. He
tells us a plain unvarnished tale, the interest of
which is to be found in the statement of the facts
exactly as they occurred. Considering that it is a
story of events all of which he saw and a large part
of which he was, there is a singular absence of prejudice.
He is no man's enemy. He has passed
through the fire, and there is no smell of smoke on
his garments. An intelligent indignation against
the crimes committed in defense of the system he
describes pervades his narrative. His impartiality
is not indifference, but an absence of personal rancor.
Individuals and their conduct are criticised
only so far as is necessary to make clear the course
of events and the condition of public feeling. The
defenders of slavery at the North and South are
regarded not as bad men, but as the outcome of a
bad system.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson's book is a treasury of facts, and
will never be superseded so far as this peculiar
value is concerned. In this respect it somewhat
resembles Hildreth's "History of the United
States." Taking little space for speculation, comment,
or picturesque coloring, there is all the more
room left for the steady flow of the narrative.</p>

<p>With a few unimportant omissions, the two volumes
now published contain a full history of slavery
and antislavery from the Ordinance of 1787
and the compromises of the Constitution down to
the election of Lincoln and the outbreak of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
civil war. As a work of reference they are invaluble,
for each event in the long struggle for freedom
is distinctly and accurately told, while the calm
story advances through its various stages. Instead
of following this narrative in detail, which our space
will not allow, we prefer to call our readers' attention
to some of the more striking incidents of this
great revolution.</p>

<p>Our fathers, when they founded the nation, had
little thought that slavery was ever to attain such
vast extension. They supposed that it would gradually
die out from the South, as it had disappeared
from the North. Yet the whole danger to their
work lay here. Slavery, if anything, was the
wedge which was to split the Union asunder.
When the Constitution was formed, in 1787, the
slaveholders, by dint of great effort, succeeded in
getting the little end of the wedge inserted. It
was very narrow, a mere sharp line, and it went in
only a very little way; so it seemed to be nothing
at all. The slaveholders at that time did not contend
that slavery was right or good. They admitted
that it was a political evil. They confessed,
many of them, that it was a moral evil. All the
great Southern revolutionary bodies had accustomed
themselves to believe in the rights of man,
in the principles of humanity, in the blessings of
liberty; and they could not <em>defend</em> slavery. Mason
of Virginia, in the debates in the Federal Convention,
denounced slavery and the slave-trade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
"The evil of slavery," said he, "affects the whole
Union. Slavery discourages arts and manufactures.
The poor despise labor when done by
slaves. They prevent the immigration of whites,
who really enrich a country. They produce the
most pernicious effects on the manners. Every master
of slaves is born a petty tyrant. They bring the
judgment of Heaven on a country." Williamson
of North Carolina declared himself in principle
and practice opposed to slavery. Madison "thought
it wrong to admit in the Constitution the idea that
there could be property in man." But the extreme
Southern States, South Carolina and Georgia, insisted
on the right of importing slaves, at least for
a little while; and so they were allowed to import
them for twenty years. They also insisted on having
their slaves represented by themselves in Congress,
and so they were allowed to count three
fifths of the slaves in determining the ratio. This
seemed a small thing, but it was the entering of
the wedge. It was tolerating the principle of slavery;
not admitting it, but tolerating it. At the
same time that this Convention was forming, the
Federal Constitution Congress was prohibiting
slavery in all the territory northwest of the Ohio.
This prohibition of slavery was adopted by the
unanimous votes of the eight States present, including
Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia. Two
years later it was recognized and confirmed by the
first Congress under the Constitution. Jefferson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
a commissioner to revise the statute law of Virginia,
prepared a bill for gradual emancipation in
that State. In 1790 a petition was presented to
Congress, signed by Benjamin Franklin, the last
public act of his life, declaring equal liberty to be
the birthright of all, and asking Congress to "devise
means for restoring liberty to the slaves, and
so removing this inconsistency from the character
of the American people." In 1804 the people of
Virginia petitioned Congress to have the Ordinance
of 1787 suspended, that they might hold slaves;
but a committee of Congress, of which John Randolph
of Virginia was chairman, reported that it
would be "highly dangerous and inexpedient to
impair a provision wisely calculated to promote the
happiness and prosperity of the Northwest Territory."</p>

<p>But in 1820 the first heavy blow came on the
wedge to drive it into the log. The Union is a
tough log, and the wedge could be driven a good
way in without splitting it; but the first blow
which drove it in was the adopting the Missouri
Compromise, allowing slavery to come North and
take possession of Missouri.</p>

<p>The thirty years of prosperity which had followed
the adoption of the Constitution had changed
the feelings of men both North and South. The
ideas of the Revolution had receded into the background;
the thirst for wealth and power had taken
their place. So the Southern States, which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
cordially agreed thirty years before to prohibit the
extension of slavery, and had readily admitted it
to be a political evil, now demanded as a right the
privilege of carrying slaves into Missouri. They
threatened to dissolve the Union, talked of a fire
only to be extinguished by seas of blood, and proposed
to hang a member from New Hampshire
who spoke of liberty. Some of the Northern men
were not frightened by these threats, and valued
them at their real worth. But we know that the
result was a compromise. Slavery was to take
possession of Missouri, on condition that no other
State as far north as Missouri should be slave-holding.
Slavery was to be excluded from the
rest of the territory forever. This bargain was
applauded and justified by Southern politicians
and newspapers as a great triumph on their part;
and it was. That fatal compromise was a surrender
of principle for the sake of peace, bartering
conscience for quiet; and we were soon to reap the
bitter fruits.</p>

<p>Face to face, in deadly opposition, each determined
on the total destruction of his antagonist,
stood this Goliath of the slave power and the little
David of antislavery, at the beginning of the ten
years which extended from 1830 to 1840. The
giant was ultimately to fall from the wounds of
his minute opponent, but not during this decade
or the next. For many years each of the parties
was growing stronger, and the fight was growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
fiercer. Organization on the one side was continually
becoming more powerful; enthusiasm on the
other continually built up a more determined opinion.
The slave power won repeated victories; but
every victory increased the number and ardor of
its opponents.</p>

<p>The first attempt to destroy antislavery principles
was by means of mobs. Mobs seldom take
place in a community unless where the upper stratum
of society and the lower are in sympathetic
opposition to some struggling minority. Then the
lower class takes its convictions from the higher,
and regards itself as the hand executing what the
head thinks ought to be done. Respectability denounces
the victim, and the rabble hastens to take
vengeance on him. Even a mob cannot act efficiently
unless inspired by ideas; and these it must
receive from some higher source. So it was when
Priestley was mobbed at Birmingham; so it was
when Wesley and his friends were mobbed in all
parts of England. So it was also in America when
the office of the "Philanthropist" was destroyed
in Cincinnati; when halls and churches were
burned in Philadelphia; when Miss Crandall was
mobbed in Connecticut; when Lovejoy was killed
at Alton. Antislavery meetings were so often invaded
by rioters, that on one occasion Stephen
S. Foster is reported to have declared that the
speakers were not doing their duty, because the
people listened so quietly. "If we were doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
our duty," said he, "they would be throwing brick-bats
at us."</p>

<p>These demonstrations only roused and intensified
the ardor of the Abolitionists, while bringing
to their side those who loved fair play, and those
in whom the element of battle was strong. Mobs
also were an excellent advertisement for the Antislavery
Society; and this is what every new cause
needs most for its extension. Every time that one
of their meetings was violently broken up, every
time that any outrage or injury was offered to the
Abolitionists, all the newspapers in the land gave
them a gratuitous advertisement by conspicuous
notices of the event. So the public mind was directed
to the question, and curiosity was excited.
The antislavery conventions were more crowded
from day to day, their journals were more in demand,
and their plans and opinions became the
subject of conversation everywhere.</p>

<p>And certainly there could be no more interesting
place to visit than one of these meetings of the
Antislavery Society. With untiring assiduity the
Abolitionists brought to their platform everything
which could excite and impress their audience.
Their orators were of every kind,&mdash;rough men
and shrill-voiced women, polished speakers from
the universities, stammering fugitives from slavery,
philosophers and fanatics, atheists and Christian
ministers, wise men who had been made mad by
oppression, and babes in intellect to whom God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
had revealed some of the noblest truths. They
murdered the King's English, they uttered glaring
fallacies, the blows aimed at evildoers often glanced
aside and hit good men. Invective was, perhaps,
the too frequent staple of their argument, and any
difference of opinion would be apt to turn their
weapons against each other. This church-militant
often became a church-termagant. Yet, after all
such abatement for errors of judgment or bad taste,
their meetings were a splendid arena on which was
fought one of the greatest battles for mankind.
The eloquence we heard there was not of the
schools, and had nothing artificial about it. It
followed the rule of Demosthenes, and was all directed
to action. Every word was a blow. There
was no respect for dignities or authorities. The
Constitution of the United States, the object of
such unfeigned idolatry to the average American,
was denounced as "a covenant with hell." The
great men of the nation, Webster, Clay, Jackson,
were usually selected as the objects of the severest
censure. The rule was to strike at the heads
which rose above the crowd, as deserving the
sternest condemnation. Presidents and governors,
heads of universities, eminent divines, great
churches and denominations, were convicted as
traitors to the right, or held up to unsparing ridicule.
No conventional proprieties were regarded
in the terrible earnestness of this enraged speech.
It was like the lava pouring from the depths of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
the earth, and melting the very rocks which opposed
its resistless course.</p>

<p>Of course this fierce attack roused as fierce a
defense. One extreme generated the other. The
cry for "immediate abolition" was answered by
labored defenses of slavery itself. Formerly its
advocates only excused it as a necessary evil; now
they began to defend it as a positive good. Then
was seen the lamentable sight of Christian ministers
and respected divines hurrying to the support
of the "sum of all villanies." The Episcopal
bishop of a New England State defended with
ardor the system of slavery as an institution supported
by the Bible and commanded by God himself.
The president of a New England college
declared slavery to be a positive institution of
revealed religion, and not inconsistent with the
law of love. The minister of a Boston church,
going to the South for his health, amused his
leisure by writing a book on slavery, in which it is
made to appear as a rose-colored and delightful
institution, and its opposers are severely censured.
One of the most learned professors in a Massachusetts
theological school composed a treatise to
refute the heresy of the higher law, and to maintain
the duty of returning fugitive slaves to bondage.
Under such guidance it was natural that the
churches should generally stand aloof from the
Abolitionists and condemn their course. It was
equally natural that the Abolitionists should then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
denounce the churches as the bulwark of slavery.
Nevertheless, from the Christian body came most
of those who devoted their lives to the extirpation
of this great evil and iniquity. And Mr. Garrison,
at least, always maintained that his converts
were most likely to be made among those whose
consciences had been educated by the Church and
the Bible.</p>

<p>From public meetings in the North, the conflict
of ideas next extended itself to the floor of Congress,
where it continued to rage during nearly thirty
years, until "the war of tongue and pen" changed
to that of charging squadrons, the storm of shot
and the roll of cannon. The question found its
way into the debates of Congress in the form of
petitions for the abolition of slavery and the slave-trade
in the District of Columbia. If the slaveholders
had allowed these petitions to be received
and referred, taking no notice of them, it seems
probable that no important results would have
followed. But, blinded by rage and fear, they
opposed their reception, thus denying a privilege
belonging to all mankind,&mdash;that of asking the
government to redress their grievances. Then
came to the front a man already eminent by his
descent, his great attainments, his long public
service, his great position, and his commanding
ability. John Quincy Adams, after having been
President of the United States, accepted a seat in
the House of Representatives, and was one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
most laborious and useful of its members. He
was not then an Abolitionist, nor in favor even of
abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia.
But he believed that the people had the right to
petition the government for anything they desired,
and that their respectful petitions should be respectfully
received. Sixty-five years old in 1832,
when he began this conflict, his warfare with the
slave power ended only when, struck with death
while in his seat, he saw the last of earth and was
content. With what energy, what dauntless courage,
what untiring industry, what matchless powers
of argument, what inexhaustible resources of knowledge,
he pursued his object, the future historian
of the struggle who can fully paint what Mr.
Wilson is only able to indicate, will take pleasure
in describing. One scene will remain forever memorable
as one of the most striking triumphs of
human oratory; and this we must describe a little
more fully.</p>

<p>February 6, 1837, being the day for presenting
petitions, Mr. Adams had already presented
several petitions for the abolition of slavery in the
District of Columbia (a measure to which he was
himself then opposed), when he proceeded to <span class="locked">state<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span>
that he had in his possession a paper upon which
he wished the decision of the Speaker. The paper,
he said, came from twenty persons declaring themselves
to be slaves. He wished to know whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
the Speaker would consider this paper as coming
under the rule of the <span class="locked">House.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span> The Chair said he
would take the advice of the House on that question.
And thereupon began a storm of indignation
which raged around Mr. Adams during four
<span class="locked">days.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span> Considering that the House had ordered,
less than three weeks before, that all papers relating
<em>in any way</em> to slavery should be laid on the
table without any action being taken on them, this
four days' discussion about such a paper, ending
in the passing of several resolutions, was rather an
amusing illustration of the irrepressible character
of the antislavery movement. The Southern members
seemed at first astonished at what they hastily
assumed to be an attempt of Mr. Adams to introduce
a petition from slaves. One moved that it
be not received. Another, indignant at such a
tame way of meeting the question, declared that
any one attempting to introduce such a petition
should be immediately punished; and if that was
not done at once, all the members from the slave
States should leave the House. Loud cries arose,
"Expel him! expel him!" Mr. Alfred declared
that the petition ought to be burned. Mr. Waddy
Thompson of South Carolina, who soon received a
castigation which he little anticipated, moved that
John Quincy Adams, having committed a gross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
disrespect to the House in attempting to introduce
a petition from slaves, ought to be instantly
brought to the bar of the House to receive the
severe censure of the Speaker. Similar resolutions
were offered by Mr. Haynes and Mr. Lewis,
all assuming that Mr. Adams had attempted to
introduce this petition. He at last took the floor,
and said that he thought the time of the House
was being consumed needlessly, since all these
resolutions were founded on an error. He had
<em>not</em> attempted to present the petition,&mdash;he had
only asked the Speaker a question in regard to it.
He also advised the member from Alabama to
amend his resolution, which stated the petition to
be for the abolition of slavery in the District,
whereas it was the very reverse of that. It was a
petition for something which would be very objectionable
to himself, though it might be the very
thing for which the gentleman from Alabama was
contending. Then Mr. Adams sat down, leaving
his opponents more angry than ever, but somewhat
confused in their minds. They could not
very well censure him for doing what he had not
done, but they wished very much to censure him.
So Mr. Waddy Thompson modified his resolution,
making it state that Mr. Adams, "by creating the
impression, and leaving the House under the impression,
that the petition was for the abolition of
slavery," had trifled with the House, and should
receive its censure. After a multitude of other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
speeches from the enraged Southern chivalry, the
debate of the first day came to an end.</p>

<p>On the next day (February 7), in reply to a
question, Mr. Adams stated again that he had not
attempted to present the petition, though his own
feelings would have led him to do so, but had kept
it in his possession, out of respect to the House.
He had said nothing to lead the House to infer
that this petition was for the abolition of slavery.
He should consider before presenting a petition
from slaves; though, in his opinion, slaves had a
right to petition, and the mere fact of a petition
being from slaves would not of itself prevent him
from presenting it. If the petition were a proper
one, he should present it. A petition was a
prayer, a supplication to a superior being. Slaves
might pray to God; was this House so superior
that it could not condescend to hear a prayer from
those to whom the Almighty listened? He ended
by saying that, in asking the question of the
Speaker, he had intended to show the greatest
respect to the House, and had not the least purpose
of trifling with it.</p>

<p>These brief remarks of Mr. Adams made it
necessary for the slaveholders again to change
their tactics. Mr. Dromgoole of Virginia now
brought forward his famous resolution, which Mr.
Adams afterwards made so ridiculous, accusing
him of having "given color to an idea" that
slaves had a right to petition, and that he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
be censured by the Speaker for this act. Another
member proposed, rather late in the day, that a
committee be appointed to inquire whether any
attempt had been made, or not, to offer a petition
from slaves. Another offered a series of resolutions,
declaring that if any one "hereafter" should
offer petitions from slaves he ought to be regarded
as an enemy of the South, and of the Union; but
that "as John Quincy Adams had stated that he
meant no disrespect to the House, that all proceedings
as to his conduct should now cease." And
so, after many other speeches, the second day's
debate came to an end.</p>

<p>The next day was set apart to count the votes
for President, and so the debate was resumed
February 9. It soon become more confused than
ever. Motions were made to lay the resolutions
on the table; they were withdrawn; they were
renewed; they were voted down; and, finally,
after much discussion, and when at last the final
question was about being taken, Mr. Adams inquired
whether he was to be allowed to be heard
in his own defense before being condemned. So
he obtained the floor, and immediately the whole
aspect of the case was changed. During three
days he had been the prisoner at the bar; suddenly
he became the judge on the bench. Never,
in the history of forensic eloquence, has a single
speech effected a greater change in the purpose of
a deliberative assembly. Often as the Horatian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
description has been quoted of the just man, tenacious
of his purpose, who fears not the rage of citizens
clamoring for what is wrong, it has never
found a fitter application than to the unshaken
mind of John Quincy Adams, standing alone, in
the midst of his antagonists, like a solid monument
which the idle storms beat against in vain.</p>

<p>He began by saying that he had been waiting
during these three days for an answer to the question
which he had put to the Speaker, and which
the Speaker had put to the House, but which the
House had not yet answered, namely, whether the
paper he held in his hand came under the rule of
the House or not. They had discussed everything
else, but had not answered that question.
They had wasted the time of the House in considering
how they could censure him for doing what
he had not done. All he wished to know was,
whether a petition from slaves should be received
or not. He himself thought that it ought to be
received; but if the House decided otherwise, he
should not present it. Only one gentleman had
undertaken to discuss that question, and his argument
was, that if slavery was abolished by Congress
in any State, the Constitution was violated;
and, <em>therefore</em>, slaves ought not to be allowed to
petition for anything. He, Mr. Adams, was unable
to see the connection between the premises
and the conclusion.</p>

<p>Hereupon poor Mr. French, the author of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
argument, tried to explain what he meant by it,
but left his meaning as confused as before.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Adams added, that if you deprived
any one in the community of the right of petition,
which was only the right of offering a prayer, you
would find it difficult to know where to stop; one
gentleman had objected to the reception of one
petition, because offered by women of a bad character.
Mr. Patton of Virginia says he <em>knows</em> that
one of the names is of a woman of a bad character.
<em>How does he know it?</em></p>

<p>Hereupon Mr. Patton explained that he did not
himself know the woman, but had been told that
her character was not good.</p>

<p>So, said Mr. Adams, you first deny the right of
petition to slaves, then to free people of color, and
then you inquire into the moral character of a petitioner
before you receive his petition. The next
step will be to inquire into the political belief of
the petitioners before you receive your petition.
Mr. Robertson of Virginia had said that no petitions
ought to be received for an object which Congress
had no power to grant. Mr. Adams replied,
with much acuteness, that on most questions the
right of granting the petition might be in doubt:
a majority must decide that point; it would therefore
follow, from Mr. Robertson's rule, that no one
had a right to petition unless he belonged to the
predominant party. Mr. Adams then turned to
Mr. Dromgoole, who had charged him with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
remarkable crime of "giving color to an idea," and
soon made that Representative of the Old Dominion
appear very ridiculous.</p>

<p>Mr. Adams then proceeded to rebuke, with dignity
but severity, the conduct of those who had
proposed to censure him without any correct knowledge
of the facts of the case. His criticisms had
the effect of compelling these gentlemen to excuse
themselves and to offer various explanations of
their mistakes. These assailants suddenly found
themselves in an attitude of self-defense. Mr.
Adams graciously accepted their explanations, advising
them in future to be careful when they
undertook to offer resolutions of censure. He
then informed Mr. Waddy Thompson of South
Carolina that he had one or two questions to put
to him. By this time it had become a pretty
serious business to receive the attentions of Mr.
Adams; and Mr. Waddy Thompson immediately
rose to explain. But Mr. Adams asked him to
wait until he had fully stated the question which
Mr. Thompson was to answer. This Southern
statesman had threatened the ex-President of the
United States with an indictment by the grand
jury of the District for words spoken in debate in
the House of Representatives, and had added that,
if the petition was presented, Mr. Adams would be
sent to the penitentiary. "Sir," said Mr. Adams,
"the only answer I make to such a threat from
that gentleman is, to invite him, when he returns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
to his constituents, to study a little the first principles
of civil liberty." He then called on the
gentlemen from the slave States to say how many
of them indorsed that sentiment. "<em>I</em> do not," said
Mr. Underwood of Kentucky. "<em>I</em> do not," said
Mr. Wise of Virginia. Mr. Thompson was compelled
to attempt another explanation, and said
he meant that, in <em>South Carolina</em>, any member
of the legislature who should present a petition
from slaves could be indicted. "Then," replied
Mr. Adams, and this produced a great sensation,
"if it is the law of South Carolina that members
of her Legislature may be indicted by juries for
words spoken in debate, God Almighty receive my
thanks that I am not a citizen of South Carolina."</p>

<p>Mr. Adams ended his speech by declaring that
the honor of the House of Representatives was
always regarded by him as a sacred sentiment, and
that he should feel a censure from that House as
the heaviest misfortune of a long life, checkered
as it had been by many vicissitudes.</p>

<p>When Mr. Adams began his defense, not only
was a large majority of the House opposed to his
course, but they had brought themselves by a series
of violent harangues into a condition of bitter excitement
against him. When he ended, the effect
of this extraordinary speech was such, that all the
resolutions were rejected, and out of the whole
House only twenty-two members could be found
to pass a vote of even indirect censure. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
victory was won, and won by Mr. Adams almost
single-handed. We count Horatius Cocles a hero
for holding the Roman bridge against a host of
enemies; but greater honors belong to him who
successfully defends against overwhelming numbers
the ancient safeguards of public liberty. For
this reason we have repeated here at such length
the story of three days, which the people of the
United States ought always to remember. It took
ten years to accomplish the actual repeal of these
gag-laws. But the main work was done when the
right of speech was obtained for the friends of
freedom in Congress; and John Quincy Adams
was the great leader in this warfare. He was
joined on that arena by other noble champions,&mdash;Giddings,
Mann, Palfrey, John P. Hale, Chase,
Seward, Slade of Vermont, Julian of Indiana.
Others no less devoted followed them, among
whom came from Massachusetts Charles Sumner
and Henry Wilson, the author of the present
work. What he cannot properly say of himself
should be said for him. Though an accomplished
and eager politician, Henry Wilson has never sacrificed
any great principle for the sake of political
success. His services to the antislavery cause
have been invaluable, his labors in that cause unremitting.
Personal feelings and personal interests
he has been ready to sacrifice for the sake of
the cause. Loyal to his friends, he has not been
bitter to his opponents; and if any man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
fought through that long struggle were to be its
historian, no one will deny the claims of Mr. Wilson
to that honor.</p>

<p>Under the lead of John Quincy Adams, the
power to discuss the whole subject of slavery in
the National Legislature was won, and never again
lost. This was the second triumph of the antislavery
movement; its first was the power won by
Garrison and his friends of discussing the subject
before the people. The wolfish mob in the cities
and in Congress might continue to howl, but it had
lost its claws and teeth. But now came the first
great triumph of the slave power, in the annexation
of Texas. This was a cruel blow to the
friends of freedom. It was more serious because
the motive of annexation was openly announced,
and the issue distinctly presented in the Presidential
election. Mr. Upshur, Tyler's Secretary of
State, in an official dispatch, declared that the
annexation of Texas was necessary to secure the
institution of slavery. The Democratic Convention
which nominated Mr. Polk for the Presidency
deliberately made the annexation of Texas
the leading feature of its platform. Nor was the
slave power in this movement opposed merely by
the antislavery feeling of the country. Southern
senators helped to defeat the measure when first
presented in the form of a treaty by Mr. Tyler's
administration. Nearly the whole Whig party
was opposed to it. The candidate of the Whigs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
Henry Clay, had publicly declared that annexation
would be a great evil to the nation. Twenty
members of Congress, with John Quincy Adams at
their head, had proclaimed in an address to their
constituents that it would be equivalent to a dissolution
of the Union. Dr. Channing, in 1838, had
said that it would be better for the nation to perish
than to commit such an outrageous wrong.
Edward Everett, in 1837, spoke of annexation as
"an enormous crime." Whig and Democratic
legislatures had repeatedly denounced it. In 1843,
when the Democrats had a majority in the Massachusetts
legislature, they resolved that "under no
circumstances whatever" could the people of Massachusetts
approve of annexation. Martin Van
Buren opposed it as unjust to Mexico. Senator
Benton, though previously in favor of the measure,
in a speech in Missouri declared that the
object of those who were favoring the scheme was
to dissolve the Union, though he afterward came
again to its support. And yet when the Presidential
campaign was in progress, a Democratic torchlight
procession miles long was seen marching
through the streets of Boston, and flaunting the
lone star of Texas along its whole line. And when
Polk was elected, and the decision of the nation
virtually given for this scheme, it seemed almost
hopeless to contend longer against such a triumph
of slavery. If the people of the North could submit
to this outrage, it appeared as if they could
submit to anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
Such, however, was not the case. On one side
the slave power was greatly strengthened by the
admission of Texas to the Union as a slave State;
but, on the other hand, there came a large accession
to the antislavery body. And this continued
to be the case during many years. The slave
power won a succession of political victories, each
of which was a moral victory to its opponents.
Many who were not converted to antislavery by
the annexation of Texas in 1845 were brought over
by the defeat of the Wilmot Proviso and the passage
of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850. Many
who were not alarmed by these successes of slavery
were convinced of the danger when they beheld the
actual working of the Fugitive Slave Act. How
many Boston gentlemen, before opposed to the
Abolitionists, were brought suddenly to their side
when they saw the Court House in chains, and were
prevented by soldiers guarding Anthony Burns
from going to their banks or insurance offices in
State Street! All those bitter hours of defeat and
disaster planted the seeds of a greater harvest for
freedom. Others who remained insensible to the
disgrace of the slave laws of 1850 were recruited
to the ranks of freedom by the repeal of the Missouri
Compromise in 1854. This last act, Mr.
Wilson justly says, did more than any other to
arouse the North, and convince it of the desperate
encroachments of slavery. Men who tamely acquiesced
in <em>this</em> great wrong were startled into moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
life by the murderous assault on Charles Sumner
by Preston Brooks in 1856. Those who could submit
to this were roused by the border ruffians from
Missouri who invaded Kansas, and made the proslavery
Constitution for that State. The Dred
Scott decision in 1857, which declared slavery to
be no local institution, limited to a single part of
the land, but having a right to exist in the free
States under the Constitution, alarmed even those
who had been insensible to the previous aggressions
of slavery. This series of political successes
of the slave power was appalling. Every principle
of liberty, every restraint on despotism, was overthrown
in succession, until the whole power of the
nation had fallen into the hands of an oligarchy of
between three and four hundred thousand slaveholders.
But every one of their political victories
was a moral defeat; every access to their strength
as an organization added an immense force to the
public opinion opposed to them; and each of their
successes was responded to by some advance of the
antislavery movement. The annexation of Texas
in 1845 was answered by the appearance of John
P. Hale, in 1847, in the United States Senate,&mdash;the
first man who was elected to that body on distinctly
antislavery grounds and independent of
either of the great parties. The response to the
defeat of the Wilmot Proviso and passage of the
Fugitive Slave Law in 1850 was the election of
Charles Sumner to the Senate in April, 1851, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
the establishment of the underground railroad in
all the free States. When the South abrogated
the Missouri Compromise, the North replied by the
initiation of the Republican party. The Kansas
outrages gave to freedom John Brown of Osawatomie.
And the answer to the Dred Scott decision
was the nomination of Abraham Lincoln. Till
that moment the forces of freedom and slavery had
stood opposed, like two great armies, each receiving
constant recruits and an acccession of new
power. On one side, hitherto, had been all the
political triumphs, and on the other all the moral.
But with this first great political success of their
opponents the slave power became wholly demoralized,
gave up the conflict, threw away the results
of all its former victories, and abandoned the field
to its enemies, plunging into the dark abyss of secession
and civil war.</p>

<p>And yet, what was the issue involved in that
election? It was simply whether slavery should
or should not be extended into new Territories.
All that the Republican party demanded was that
slavery should not be extended. It did not dream
of abolishing slavery in the slave States. We remember
how, long after the war began, we refused
to do this. The Southerners had every guaranty
they could desire that they should not be interfered
with at home. If they had gracefully acquiesced
in the decision of the majority, their institution
might have flourished for another century. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
Fugitive Slave Law would have been repealed; or,
at all events, trial by jury would have been given
to the man claimed as a fugitive. But no attempt
would have been made by the Republican party to
interfere with slavery in the slave States, for that
party did not believe it had the right so to do.</p>

<p>But, in truth, the course of the Southern leaders
illustrated in a striking way the distinction between
a politician and a statesman. They were very acute
politicians, trained in all the tactics of their art;
but they were poor statesmen, incapable of any
large strategic plan of action. As statesmen, they
should have made arrangements for the gradual
abolition of slavery, as an institution incapable of
sustaining itself in civilized countries in the nineteenth
century. Or, if they wished to maintain it
as long as possible, they ought to have seen that
this could only be accomplished by preserving the
support of the interests and the public opinion of
the North. Alliance with the Northern States was
their only security; and, therefore, they ought to
have kept the Northern conscience on their side by
a loyal adherence to all compacts and covenants.
Instead of this, they contrived to outrage, one by
one, every feeling of honor, every sentiment of
duty, and every vested right of the free States,
until, at last, it became plain to all that it was an
"irrepressible conflict," and must be settled definitely
either for slavery or for freedom. When
this point was reached by the American people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
they saw also that it could not be settled in favor
of slavery, for no concession would satisfy the slaveholders,
and no contract these might make could be
depended on. The North gave them, in 1850, the
Fugitive Slave Law for the sake of peace. Did it
gain peace? No. It relinquished, for the sake
of peace, the Wilmot Proviso. Was the South
satisfied? No. In 1853 Mr. Douglas offered it
the Nebraska Bill. Was it contented? By no
means. Mr. Pierce and Mr. Buchanan did their
best to give it Kansas. Did they content the South
by their efforts? No. Mr. Douglas, Mr. Pierce,
and Mr. Buchanan were all set aside by the South.
The Lecompton Bill was not enough. The Dred
Scott decision was not enough. The slaveholders
demanded that slavery should be established by a
positive act of Congress in all the Territories of
the Union. Even Judge Douglas shrank aghast
from the enterprise of giving them such a law as
that; and so Judge Douglas was immediately
thrown aside. Thus, by the folly of the Southern
leaders themselves, more than by the efforts of their
opponents, the majority was obtained by the Republicans
in the election of 1860.</p>

<p>But during this conflict came many very dark
days for freedom. One of these was after the passage
of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850. That law
was one of a series of compromises, intended to
make a final settlement of the question and to silence
all antislavery agitation. Although defended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
by great lawyers, who thought it necessary to save
the Union, there is little doubt that it was as unconstitutional
as it was cruel. The Constitution
declares that "no person shall be deprived of his
liberty without due process of law," and also that
"in suits at common law, when the value in controversy
shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial
by jury shall be preserved." Anthony Burns was
in full possession of his liberty; he was a self-supporting,
tax-paying citizen of Massachusetts; and
in ten days, by the action of the Fugitive Slave
Law, he was turned into a slave under the decision
of a United States commissioner, without seeing a
judge or a jury. The passage of this law, and its
actual enforcement, caused great excitement among
the free colored people at the North, as well as
among the fugitives from slavery. No one was
safe. It was evident that it was meant to be enforced,&mdash;it
was not meant to be idle thunder.
But instead of discouraging the friends of freedom,
it roused them to greater activity. More fugitives
than ever came from the slave States, and the
underground railroad was in fuller activity than
before. The methods employed by fugitives to escape
were very various and ingenious. One man
was brought away in a packing-box. Another
clung to the lower side of the guard of a steamer,
washed by water at every roll of the vessel. One
well-known case was that of Ellen Crafts, who
came from Georgia disguised as a young Southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
gentleman, attended by her husband as body-servant.
She rode in the cars, sitting near Southerners
who knew her, but did not recognize her in
this costume, and at last arrived safe in Philadelphia.
In one instance a slave escaped from Kentucky,
with all his family, walking some distance
on stilts, in order to leave no scent for the pursuing
blood-hounds. When these poor people reached
the North, and told their stories on the antislavery
platform, they excited great sympathy, which was
not confined to professed antislavery people. A
United States commissioner, who might be called
on to return fugitives to bondage, frequently had
them concealed in his own house, by the action of
his wife, whose generous heart never wearied in
this work, and who was the means of saving many
from bondage. A Democratic United States marshal,
in Boston, whose duty it was to arrest fugitive
slaves, was in the habit of telling the slave-owner
who called on him for assistance that he "did not
know anything about niggers, but he would find
out where the man was from those who did."
Whereupon he would go directly to Mr. Garrison's
office and tell him he wanted to arrest such or such
a man, a fugitive from slavery. "But," said he,
"curiously enough, the next thing I heard would
be, that the fellow was in Canada." And when a
colored man was actually sent back to slavery, as
in the case of Burns, the event excited so much
sympathy with the fugitive, and so much horror of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
the law, that its effects were disastrous to the slave
power. Thomas M. Simms was arrested in Boston
as a fugitive from slavery, April 3, 1851, and was
sent to slavery by the decision of George Ticknor
Curtis, a United States commissioner. The answer
to this act, by Massachusetts, was the election of
Charles Sumner, twenty-one days after, to the
United States Senate. Anthony Burns was returned
to slavery by order of Edward G. Loring,
in May, 1854; and Massachusetts responded by
removing him from his office as Judge of Probate,
and refusing his confirmation as a professor in Harvard
University.</p>

<p>The passage of what were called the compromise
measures of 1850, including the Fugitive Slave
Law, had, it was fondly believed, put an end to the
whole antislavery agitation. The two great parties,
Whig and Democrat, had agreed that such should
be the case. The great leaders, Henry Clay and
Daniel Webster, Cass and Buchanan, were active
in calling on the people to subdue their prejudices
in favor of freedom. Southern fire-eaters, like
Toombs and Alexander Stephens, joined these
Union-savers, and became apostles of peace. Agitation
was the only evil, and agitation must now
come to an end. Public meetings were held in the
large cities,&mdash;one in Castle Garden in New York,
another in Faneuil Hall in Boston. In these meetings
the lion and the lamb lay down together.
Rufus Choate and Benjamin Hallet joined in demanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
that all antislavery agitation should now
cease. The church was called upon to assist in the
work of Union-saving, and many leading divines
lent their aid in this attempt to silence those who
desired that the oppressed should go free, and who
wished to break every yoke. Many seemed to suppose
that all antislavery agitation was definitely
suppressed. President Fillmore called the compromise
measures "a final adjustment." All the
powers which control human opinion&mdash;the two
great political parties, the secular and the religious
newspapers, the large churches and popular divines,
the merchants and lawyers&mdash;had agreed that the
antislavery agitation should now <span class="locked">cease.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span></p>

<p>But just at that moment, when the darkness was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
the deepest, and all the great powers in the church
and state had decreed that there should be no more
said concerning American slavery, the voice of a
woman broke the silence, and American slavery
became the one subject of discussion throughout
the world. "Uncle Tom's Cabin" was written by
Mrs. Stowe for the "National Era," Dr. Bailey's
paper in Washington. It was intended to be a
short story, running through two or three numbers
of the journal, and she was to receive a hundred
dollars for writing it. But, as she wrote, the fire
burned in her soul, a great inspiration came over
her, and, not knowing what she was about to do,
she moved the hearts of two continents to their
very depths. After her story had appeared in the
newspaper, she offered it as a novel to several publishers,
who refused it. Accepted at last, it had a
circulation unprecedented in the annals of literature.
In eight weeks its sale had reached one hundred
thousand copies in the United States, while
in England a million copies were sold within the
year. On the European Continent the sale was
immense. A single publisher in Paris issued five
editions in a few weeks, and before the end of 1852
it was translated into Italian, Spanish, Danish,
Swedish, Dutch, Flemish, German, Polish, and
Magyar. To these were afterward added translations
into Portuguese, Welsh, Russian, Arabic, and
many other languages. For a time, it stopped the
publication and sale of all other works; and within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
a year or two from the day when the politicians
had decided that no more should be said concerning
American slavery, it had become the subject of
conversation and discussion among millions.</p>

<p>"Uncle Tom's Cabin" was published in 1852.
Those were very dark hours in the great struggle
for freedom. Who that shared them can ever forget
the bitterness caused by the defection of Daniel
Webster, and his 7th of March speech in 1850;
by the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law, which
made the whole area of the free States a hunting-ground
for the slaveholders; and by the rejection
of the Wilmot Proviso, which abandoned all the
new territory to slavery? This was followed by
the election of Franklin Pierce as President in
1852, on a platform in which the Democratic party
pledged itself to resist all agitation of the subject
of slavery in Congress or outside of it. And in
December, 1853, Stephen A. Douglas introduced
his Nebraska Bill, which repealed the Missouri
Compromise of 1820, and opened all the territory
heretofore secured to freedom to slaveholders and
their slaves. This offer on the part of Mr. Douglas
was a voluntary bid for the support of the slaveholders
in the next Presidential election. And in
spite of all protests from the North, all resistance
by Democrats as well as their opponents, all arguments
and appeals, this solemn agreement between
the North and the South was violated, and every
restriction on slavery removed. Nebraska and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
Kansas were organized as Territories, and the
question of slavery left to local tribunals, or what
was called "squatter sovereignty."</p>

<p>The passage of this measure showed the vast
political advance of the slave power in the country,
and how greatly it had corrupted the political conscience
of the nation. It also showed, to those
who had eyes, that slavery was the wedge which
was to split the Union asunder. But there were
in the North many persons who still thought that
danger to the Union came rather from the <em>discussion</em>
of slavery than from slavery itself. They supposed
that if all opposition to slavery should cease,
then there would be no more danger. The Abolitionists
were the cause of all the peril; and the
way to save the Union was to silence the Abolitionists.
That, however, had been tried ineffectually
when they were few and weak; and now it was
too late, as these Union-savers ought to have seen.</p>

<p>Mr. Douglas and his supporters defended their
cause by maintaining that the Missouri Compromise
was not a contract, but a simple act of legislation,
and they tauntingly asked, "Why, since
antislavery men had always thought that Compromise
a bad thing, should they now object to its
being repealed?" Even this sophism had its
effect with some, who did not notice that Douglas's
resolutions only repealed that half of the Compromise
which was favorable to freedom, while
letting the other half remain. One part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
Act of 1820 was that Missouri should be admitted
as a slave State; the other part was that all the
rest of the Territory should be forever free. Only
the last part was now repealed. Missouri was left
in the Union as a slave State.</p>

<p>The political advance now made by slavery will
appear from the following <span class="locked">facts:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In 1797 the slave power asked for only life; it
did not wish to extend itself; it united with the
North in prohibiting its own extension into the
Northwest Territory.</p>

<p>In 1820 it did wish to extend itself; it refused
to be shut out of Missouri, but was willing that
the rest of the Territory should be always free.</p>

<p>In 1845 it insisted on extending itself by annexing
Texas, but it admitted that it had no right to
go into any Territory as far north as Missouri.</p>

<p>In 1850 it refused to be shut out of any of the
new territory, and resisted the Wilmot Proviso;
but still confessed that it had no right to go into
Kansas or Nebraska.</p>

<p>Five years after, by the efforts of Stephen A.
Douglas and Franklin Pierce, it refused to be shut
out of Kansas, and repealed the part of the Missouri
Compromise which excluded it from that
region. But, in order to accomplish this repeal, it
took the plausible name of "popular sovereignty,"
and claimed that the people should themselves
decide whether they would have a slave State or
a free State.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
One additional step came. The people decided
or were about to decide for freedom; and then the
slave power set aside its own doctrine of popular
sovereignty and invaded the Territory with an
army of Missourians, chose a legislature for the
people of Kansas composed of Missourians, who
passed laws establishing slavery and punishing
with fine and imprisonment any who should even
speak against it.</p>

<p>The people of Kansas refused to obey these
laws. They would have been slaves already if they
had obeyed them. Then their own governor, appointed
by our President, led an army of Missourians
to destroy their towns and plunder and
murder their people. Nothing was left them but
to resist. They did resist manfully but prudently,
and by a remarkable combination of courage and
caution the people of the little Free-State town of
Lawrence succeeded in saving themselves from this
danger without shedding a drop of blood. Men,
women, and children were animated by the same
heroic spirit. The women worked by the side of
the men. The men were placed on the outposts as
sentinels and ordered by their general not to fire
as long as they could possibly avoid it. And these
men stood on their posts, and allowed themselves
to be shot at by the invaders, and did not return
the fire. One man received two bullets through
his hat, and was ready to fire if the enemy came
nearer, but neither fired nor quitted his post.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
The men were brave and obedient to orders; the
women were resolute, sagacious, and prudent. So
they escaped their first great danger.</p>

<p>But slavery does not give up its point so easily
after one defeat. Preparations were made along
the Missouri frontier for another invasion, conducted
in a more military manner and by troops
under better discipline. The Free-State people of
Kansas were to be exterminated. From week to
week they were expecting an attack, and had to
watch continually against it. After having worked
all day the men were obliged to do military duty
and stand guard all night. Men who lived four
and five miles out from Lawrence got wood and
water for their wives in the morning, left them a
revolver with which to defend themselves, and
went to Lawrence to do military duty, returning
at night again.</p>

<p>If we had a writer gifted with the genius of
Macaulay to describe the resistance of Kansas to
the Federal authorities on one side and the Missouri
invaders on the other, it would show as heroic
courage and endurance as are related in the brilliant
pages which tell of the defense of Londonderry.
The invaders were unscrupulous, knowing
that they had nothing to fear from the government
at Washington. Senator Atchison, formerly the
presiding officer of the United States Senate,
openly advised the people of Missouri to go and
vote in Kansas. General Stringfellow told them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
to take their bowie-knives and exterminate every
scoundrel who was tainted with Free-soilism or
Abolitionism. The orders were obeyed. The first
legislature was elected by armed invaders from
Missouri, and Buford with a regiment of Southern
soldiers entered the Territory in 1856, and surrounded
Lawrence. These troops, under Atchison,
Buford, and Stringfellow, burned houses and
hotels, and stole much property. Osawatomie was
sacked and burned, Leavenworth invaded and
plundered, and Free-State men were killed. A
proslavery constitution formed by Missouri slaveholders
was forced through Congress, but rejected
by the people of Kansas, who at last gained possession
of their own State by indomitable courage and
patience. Four territorial governors, appointed by
the President, selected from the Democratic party
and favorable to the extension of slavery, were all
converted to the cause of freedom by the sight of
the outrages committed by the Missouri invaders.</p>

<p>Amid this scene of tumult arose a warrior on
the side of freedom destined to take his place with
William Wallace and William Tell among the
few names of patriots which are never forgotten.
John Brown of Osawatomie was one of those
who, in these later days, have reproduced for us
the almost forgotten type of the Jewish hero and
prophet. He was a man who believed in a God of
justice, who believed in fighting fire with fire. He
was one who came in the spirit and power of Elijah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
an austere man, a man absorbed in his ideas,
fixed as fate in pursuing them. Yet his heart was
full of tenderness, he had no feeling of revenge
toward any, and he really lost his own life rather
than risk the lives of others. While in Kansas he
become a leader of men, a captain, equal to every
exigency. The ruffians from Missouri found to
their surprise that, before they could conquer Kansas,
they had some real fighting to do, and must
face Sharpe's rifles; and as soon as they understood
this, their zeal for their cause was very much
abated. In this struggle John Brown was being
educated for the last scene of his life, which has
lifted up his name, and placed it in that body
which Daniel O'Connell used to call "The order
of <span class="locked">Liberators."<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span></p>

<p>Out of these persecutions of Free-State men in
Kansas came the assault on Charles Sumner, for
words spoken in debate. Charles Sumner was
elected to the United States Senate in 1851. He
found in Congress some strong champions of freedom.
John Quincy Adams was gone; but Seward
was there, and Chase, and John P. Hale, in the
Senate; and Horace Mann, Giddings, and other
true men in the House. Henry Wilson himself,
always a loyal friend to Sumner, did not come till
1855. These men all differed from one another,
and each possessed special gifts for his arduous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
work. They stood face to face with an imperious
majority, accustomed to rule. They had only imperfect
support at home,&mdash;people and press at
the North had been demoralized by slavery. They
must watch their words, be careful of what they
said, control their emotions, maintain an equal
temper. Something of the results of this discipline
we think we perceive in the calm tone of Mr.
Wilson's volumes, and the absence of passion in
his narration. These men must give no occasion
to the enemy to blaspheme, but be careful of their
lips and their lives. Their gifts, we have said,
were various. Seward was a politician, trained in
all the intricate ways of New York party struggles;
but he was also a thinker of no small power
of penetration. He could see principles, but was
too much disposed to sacrifice or postpone them to
some supposed exigency of the hour. In his orations,
when he spoke for mankind, his views were
large; but in his politics he sometimes gave up to
party his best-considered convictions. Thought
and action, he seemed to believe, belonged to two
spheres; in his thought he was often broader in
his range than any other senator, but in action he
was frequently tempted to temporize. Mr. Chase
was a man of a different sort. He had no disposition
to concede any of his views. A cautious man,
he moved slowly; but when he had taken his position,
he was not disposed to leave it. John P.
Hale was admirable in reply. His retorts were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
rapid and keen, and yet were uttered so good-naturedly,
and with so much wit, that it was difficult
for his opponents to take offense. But
Charles Sumner was "the noblest Roman of them
all." With a more various culture, a higher tone
of moral sentiment, he was also a learned student
and a man of implacable opinions. He never
could comprehend Mr. Seward's diplomacy, and
probably Mr. Seward could never understand Sumner's
inability to compromise. He was deficient
in imagination and in tact; therefore he could not
enter into the minds of others, and imperfectly
understood them. But the purity of his soul and
life, the childlike simplicity of his purposes, and
the sweetness of his disposition, were very charming
to those who knew him well. Add to this the
resources of a mind stored with every kind of
knowledge, and a memory which never forgot anything,
and his very presence in Washington gave
an added value to the place. He had seen men
and cities, and was intimate with European celebrities,
but yet was an Israelite indeed in whom was
no guile. Fond of the good opinions of others,
and well pleased with their approbation, he never
sacrificed a conviction to win their praise or to
avoid their censure. Certainly, he was one of the
purest men who ever took part in American politics.</p>

<p>It was such a man as this, so gifted and adorned,
so spotless and upright, who by the wise providence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
of God was permitted to be the victim of a
brutal assassin. It was this noble head, the instrument
of laborious thought for the public welfare,
which was beaten and bruised by the club of
a ruffian, on May 22, 1856. Loud was the triumph
through the South, great the joy of the slave
power. They had disabled, with cruel blows, their
chief enemy. Little did they foresee&mdash;bad men
never do foresee&mdash;that Charles Sumner was to
return to his seat, and become a great power in the
land, long after their system had been crushed, and
their proud States trampled into ruin by the tread
of Northern armies. They did not foresee that he
was to be the trusted counselor of Lincoln during
those years of war; and that, after they had been
conquered, he would become one of their best
friends in their great calamity, and repay their
evil with good.</p>

<p>This murderous assault on Mr. Sumner cannot
be considered as having strengthened the political
position of the slave power. It was a great mistake
in itself, and it was a greater mistake in being
indorsed by such multitudes in the slave States.
In thus taking the responsibility of the act, they
fully admitted that brutality, violence, and cowardly
attempts at assassination are natural characteristics
of slavery. A thrill of horror went
through the civilized world on this occasion. All
the free States felt themselves outraged. That
an attempt should be made to kill in his seat a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
Northern man, for words spoken in debate, was a
gross insult and wrong to the nation, and deepened
everywhere the detestation felt for the system.</p>

<p>But madness must have its perfect work. One
more step remained to be taken by the slave power,
and that was to claim the right, under the Constitution,
and protected by the general government,
to carry slaves and slavery into all the Territories.
It was not enough that they were not prohibited
by acts of Congress. They must not allow the
people of the Territories to decide for themselves
whether slavery should exist among them or not.
It had a right to exist there, in spite of the people.
A single man from South Carolina, going with his
slaves into Nebraska, should have the power of
making that a slave State, though all the rest of its
inhabitants wished it to be free. And if he were
troubled by his neighbors, he had a right to call
on the military power of the United States to protect
him against them. Such was the doctrine of
the Dred Scott case, such the doctrine accepted by
the majority of the United States Senate under the
lead of Jefferson Davis in the spring of 1859.
Such was the doctrine demanded by the Southern
members of the Democratic Convention in Charleston,
S.&nbsp;C., in May, 1860, and, failing to carry it,
they broke up that convention. And it was because
they were defeated in this purpose of carrying
slavery into the Territories that they seceded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
from the Union, and formed the Southern Confederacy.</p>

<p>They had gained a long succession of political
triumphs, which we have briefly traced in this
article. They had annexed Texas, and made another
slave State of that Territory. They had established
the principle that slavery was not to be
excluded by law from any of the Territories of the
nation. They had repealed the Missouri Compromise,
passed the Fugitive Slave Law, obtained the
Dred Scott decision from the Supreme Court. In
all this they had been aided by the Democratic
party, and were sure of the continued help of that
party. With these allies, they were certain to
govern the country for a long period of years.
The President, the Senate, the Supreme Court,
were all on their side. As regarded slavery in the
States, there was nothing to threaten its existence
there. The Republicans proposed only to restrict
it to the region where it actually existed, but could
not and would not meddle with it therein. If the
slave power had been satisfied with this, it seems
probable that it might have retained its ascendency
in the country for a long period. An immense
region was still open to its colonies. Cotton was
still king, and the slaveholders possessed all the
available cotton-growing regions. They were
wealthy, they were powerful, they governed the
nation. They threw all this power away by seceding
from the Union. Why did they do this?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
The frequent answer to this question is contained
in the proverb, "Whom the gods would destroy
they first make mad." No doubt this act
was one of madness, and no doubt it was providential.
But Providence works not by direct interference,
but by maintaining the laws of cause and
effect. Why did they become so mad? Why this
supreme folly of relinquishing actual enormous
power, in order to set their lives and fortunes on
the hazard of a die?</p>

<p>It seems to be the doom of all vaulting ambition
to overleap itself, and to fall on the other side.
When Macbeth had gained all his ends, when he
had become Thane of Cawdor and Glamis, and
king, he had no peace, because the succession had
been promised to <span class="locked">Banquo:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,<br /></span>

<p>When Napoleon the First was master of nearly
all Europe, he could not be satisfied while England
resisted his power, and Russia had not submitted
to it. So <em>he</em> also <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span></p><div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0q">"Rather than so, come fate into the list,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p class="in0">He also threw away all his immense power because
he could not arrest his own course or limit his own
demands on fate. Such ambitions cannot stop, so
long as there is anything unconquered or unpossessed.
"All this avails me nothing, so long as I
see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate."
The madness which seizes those greedy of power
is like the passion of the gamester, who is unable
to limit his desire of gain. By this law of insatiable
ambition Providence equalizes destinies, and
power is prevented from being consolidated in a
few hands.</p>

<p>The motive which actuates these ambitions, and
makes them think that nothing is gained so long as
anything remains to be gained, seems to be a secret
fear that they are in danger of losing all unless
they can obtain more.</p>

<p>This inward dread appears to have possessed
the hearts of the Southern slaveholders. Since
slavery has been abolished, many of them admit
that they have more content in their present
poverty than they formerly had in their large
possessions. They were then sensitive to every
suggestion which touched their institution. Hence
their persecution of Abolitionists, hence their
cruelty to the slaves themselves,&mdash;for cruelty is
often the child of fear. Hence the atrocity of the
slave laws. Hence the desire to secure more and
larger guaranties from the United States for their
institution. Every rumor in the air troubled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
them. The fact that antislavery opinion existed
at the North, that it was continually increasing,
that a great political party was growing up which
was opposed to their system, that such men as
Garrison and Wendell Phillips existed in Boston,
that Seward and Sumner were in the Senate,&mdash;all
this was intolerable. The only way of accounting
for Southern irritability, for Southern
aggressions, for its perpetual demand for more
power, is to be found in this latent terror. They
doubted whether the foundations of their whole
system were not rotten; they feared that it rested
on falsehood and lies; they secretly felt that it
was contrary to the will of God; an instinct in
their souls told them that it was opposed to the
spirit of the age and the laws of progress; and
this fear made them frantic.</p>

<p>When men's minds are in this state, they are
like the glass toy called a Rupert's bubble. A
single scratch on the surface causes it to fly in
pieces. The scratch on the surface of the slave
system which caused it to rush into secession and
civil war was the attempt of John Brown on
Harper's Ferry. It seemed a trifle, but it indicated
a great deal. It was the first drop of a coming
storm. When one man was able to lay down
his life, in a conflict with their system, with such
courage and nobleness, in a cause not his own, a
shudder ran through the whole South. To what
might this grow? And so they said, "Let us cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
ourselves wholly off from these dreadful fanaticisms,
from these terrible dangers. Let us make a
community of our own, and shut out from it entirely
all antislavery opinion, and live only with
those who think as we do." And so came the end.</p>

<p>In reviewing Mr. Wilson's work, we have thus
seen how it describes the gradual and simultaneous
growth in the United States of two hostile powers,&mdash;one
political, the other moral. The one continued
to accumulate the outward forces which
belong to the organization; the other, the inward
forces which are associated with enthusiasm. The
one added continually to its external strength by
the passage of new laws, the addition of new territory,
the more absolute control of parties, government,
courts, the press, and the street. The other
increased its power by accumulating an intenser
conviction, a clearer knowledge, a firmer faith, and
a more devoted consecration to its cause. The
weapons of the one were force, adroitness, and
worldly interest; those of the other, faith in God,
in man, and in truth.</p>

<p>Great truths draw to their side noble auxiliaries.
So it was with the antislavery movement. The
heroism, the romance, the eloquence, the best
literature, the grandest forms of religion, the most
generous and purest characters,&mdash;all were brought
to it by a sure affinity. As Wordsworth said to
Toussaint l'Ouverture, so it might be declared
<span class="locked">here:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i10q">"Thou hast great allies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy friends are exaltations, agonies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And love, and man's unconquerable mind."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The best poets of America, Bryant, Longfellow,
Whittier, Lowell, were in full sympathy with this
cause, and their best poetry was their songs for
freedom. Shall we ever forget the caustic humor
of "Hosea Biglow" and "Birdofredum Sawin"?
And how lofty a flight of inspiration did the same
bard take, when he chanted in verses nobler, as it
seems to us, than anything since Wordsworth's
"Ode to Immortality," the Return of the Heroes
who had wrought salvation for the dear land
"bright beyond compare" among the nations!
What heroism, what tenderness, what stern rebuke,
what noble satire, have attended every event
in this long struggle, from the lyre of Whittier!
Nothing in Campbell excels the ring of some of
his trumpet-calls, nothing in Cowper the pathos of
his elegies over the martyrs of freedom. The
best men and the best women were always to be
found at the meetings of the Antislavery Society.
There were to be seen such upright lawyers as
Ellis Gray Loring and Samuel E. Sewall and John
A. Andrew, such eminent writers as Emerson,
such great preachers as Theodore Parker and
Beecher, such editors as Bryant and Greeley. To
this cause did William Ellery Channing devote
his last years and best thoughts. If the churches
as organizations stood aloof, being only "timidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
good," as organizations are apt to be, the purest of
their body were sure to be found in this great
company of latter-day saints.</p>

<p>Antislavery men had their faults. They were
often unjust to their opponents, though unintentionally
so. They were sometimes narrow and
bitter; and with them, as with all very earnest
people, any difference of opinion as to methods
seemed to involve moral obliquity. But they were
doing the great work of the age,&mdash;the most necessary
work of all,&mdash;and much might be pardoned
to their passionate love of justice and humanity.
In their meetings could be heard many of the
ablest speakers of the time, and one, the best of
all. He held the silver bow of Apollo, and dreadful
was its clangor when he launched its shafts
against spiritual wickedness in high places. Those
deadly arrows were sometimes misdirected, and
occasionally they struck the good men who were
meaning to do their duty. Such errors, we suppose,
are incident to all who are speaking and acting
in such terrible earnest; in the great day of
accounts many mistakes will have to be rectified.
But surely among the goodly company of apostles
and prophets, and in the noble army of martyrs
there assembled, few will be found more free from
the sins of selfish interest and personal ambition
than those who in Congress, in the pulpit, on the
platform, or with the pen, fought the great battle
of American freedom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
One great moral must be drawn from this story
before we close. It demonstrates, by a great historical
proof, that no evil however mighty, no
abuse however deeply rooted, can resist the power
of truth faithfully uttered and steadily applied.
If this great institution of slavery, resting on such
a foundation of enormous pecuniary interest, buttressed
by such powerful supports, fell in the life
of a single generation before the unaided power of
truth, why should we ever despair? Henceforth,
whenever a mighty evil is to be assailed, or a cruel
despotism overthrown, men will look to this history
of the greatness and decadence of slavery;
and, so encouraged, will believe that God is on the
side of justice, and that truth will always prevail
against error.</p>

<p>But to this we must add, that it is only where
free institutions exist that truth has full power in
such a conflict. We need free speech, a free
press, free schools, and free churches, in order that
truth may have a free course. The great advantage
of a republic like ours is, that it gives to
truth a fair chance in its conflict with error. The
Southern States would long ago have abolished
slavery if it had possessed such institutions. But,
though republican in form, the Southern States
were in reality an oligarchy, in which five millions
of whites and three millions of slaves were governed
by the absolute and irresponsible power of
less than half a million of slaveholders. Freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
was permitted by them except when this institution
was concerned, then it was absolutely forbidden.
No book written against their peculiar institution
could be printed on any Southern press or sold in
any Southern bookstore. No newspaper attacking
slavery was allowed to be circulated through
Southern mails. No public meeting could be held
to discuss the right and wrong of slavery. No
minister could preach against the system. No
man could express, even in conversation, his hostility
to it, without risk of personal injury. An
espionage as sharp, and an inquisition as relentless
as those of Venice or Spain, governed society, at
least in the cotton and sugar States of the Union.
But at the North opinion was free, and therefore
slavery fell. Fisher Ames compressed in an epigram
the evil and good of republican institutions.
"In a monarchy," said he, "we are in a ship, very
comfortable while things go well; but strike a
rock, and we go to the bottom. In a republic, we
are on a raft; our feet are wet, and it is not always
agreeable, but we are safe." It is a lasting proof
of the conservative power of free institutions, that
they were able to uproot such a system as slavery
by creating a moral force capable of putting it
down; that they could carry us through a civil
war, still leaving the press and speech free: that
they stood the strain of a presidential election
without taking from the voters a single right; and
so, at last, conquered a rebellion on so vast a scale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
that every European monarchy, with its immense
standing army, would have been powerless in its
presence. Let those Americans who are disposed
to disparage their own institutions bear this history
in mind. We have evils here, and great
ones; but they come at once to the surface, and
therefore can be met and overcome by the power
of intelligent opinion. So it has always been in
the past; so it will be, God aiding us, in the
future. We are about to meet the Centennial
Anniversary of our national life; and on that day
we can look back to our fathers, the founders of
the Republic, and say to them,&mdash;"You gave us
the inestimable blessing of free institutions; we
have used those institutions to destroy the only
great evil which you transmitted to us untouched.
We now can send down the Republic to our children,
pure from this stain, and capable of enduring

<p><a name="Footnote_52" id="Footnote_52" href="#FNanchor_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> The writer of this article recalls a scene which occurred in his
presence in the United States Senate early in 1851. Mr. Clay was
speaking of the antislavery agitators and of the Free-Soil party,
and said, with much bitterness, "We have put them down,&mdash;down,&mdash;down,
where they will remain; down to a place so low,
that they can never get up again." John P. Hale, never at a loss
for a reply, immediately arose and said, "The Senator from Kentucky
says that I and my friends have been put down,&mdash;down,&mdash;down,
where we shall have to stay. It may be so. Indeed, if
the Senator says so, I am afraid it <em>must</em> be so. For, if there is any
good authority on this subject, any man who knows by his own personal
and constant experience what it is to be put down, and to be
kept down, it is the honorable Senator from Kentucky." Mr.
Clay's aspirations had been so often baffled, that this was a very
keen thrust. The writer spoke to Mr. Hale shortly after, and he
said, "I do not think Mr. Clay will forgive me that hit; but I
could not help it. They may have got us down, but they shall
not trample upon us."</p></div>
